In addition to Series Primitives, the library now supports Pane Primitives. These are essentially the same as Series Primitives but are designed to draw on the pane of a chart rather than being associated with a specific series. Pane Primitives can be used for features like watermarks or other chart-wide annotations.

## Key Differences from Series Primitives[​](#key-differences-from-series-primitives "Direct link to Key Differences from Series Primitives")

1. Pane Primitives are attached to the chart pane rather than a specific series.
2. They cannot draw on the price and time scales.
3. They are ideal for chart-wide features that are not tied to a particular series.

## Adding a Pane Primitive[​](#adding-a-pane-primitive "Direct link to Adding a Pane Primitive")

Pane Primitives can be added to a chart using the `attachPrimitive` method on the [`IPaneApi`](/lightweight-charts/docs/api/interfaces/IPaneApi) interface. Here's an example:

```prism-code
const chart = createChart(document.getElementById('container'));  
const pane = chart.panes()[0]; // Get the first (main) pane  
  
const myPanePrimitive = new MyCustomPanePrimitive();  
pane.attachPrimitive(myPanePrimitive);
```

## Implementing a Pane Primitive[​](#implementing-a-pane-primitive "Direct link to Implementing a Pane Primitive")

To create a Pane Primitive, you should implement the [`IPanePrimitive`](/lightweight-charts/docs/api/type-aliases/IPanePrimitive) interface. This interface is similar to [`ISeriesPrimitive`](/lightweight-charts/docs/api/type-aliases/ISeriesPrimitive), but with some key differences:

* It doesn't include methods for drawing on price and time scales.
* The `paneViews` method is used to define what will be drawn on the chart pane.

Here's a basic example of a Pane Primitive implementation:

```prism-code
class MyCustomPanePrimitive {  
    paneViews() {  
        return [  
            {  
                renderer: {  
                    draw: target => {  
                        // Custom drawing logic here  
                    },  
                },  
            },  
        ];  
    }  
  
    // Other methods as needed...  
}
```
