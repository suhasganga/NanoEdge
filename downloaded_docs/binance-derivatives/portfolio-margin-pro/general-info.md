# General Info

## General API Information[​](/docs/derivatives/portfolio-margin-pro/general-info#general-api-information "Direct link to General API Information")

* The following base endpoints are available:
  + **<https://api.binance.com>**
  + **<https://api1.binance.com>**
  + **<https://api2.binance.com>**
  + **<https://api3.binance.com>**
  + **<https://api4.binance.com>**
* The last 4 endpoints in the point above (`api1`-`api4`) might give better performance but have less stability. Please use whichever works best for your setup.
* All endpoints return either a JSON object or array.
* Data is returned in **ascending** order. Oldest first, newest last.
* All time and timestamp related fields are in **milliseconds**.
* The base endpoint **<https://data-api.binance.vision>** can be used to access the following API endpoints that have `NONE` as security type:
  + [GET /api/v3/aggTrades](/docs/derivatives/portfolio-margin-pro/general-info#compressed-aggregate-trades-list)
  + [GET /api/v3/avgPrice](/docs/derivatives/portfolio-margin-pro/general-info#current-average-price)
  + [GET /api/v3/depth](/docs/derivatives/portfolio-margin-pro/general-info#order-book)
  + [GET /api/v3/exchangeInfo](/docs/derivatives/portfolio-margin-pro/general-info#exchange-information)

  + [GET /api/v3/uiKlines](/docs/derivatives/portfolio-margin-pro/general-info#uiklines)

### HTTP Return Codes[​](/docs/derivatives/portfolio-margin-pro/general-info#http-return-codes "Direct link to HTTP Return Codes")

* HTTP `4XX` return codes are used for malformed requests;
  the issue is on the sender's side.
* HTTP `403` return code is used when the WAF Limit (Web Application Firewall) has been violated.
* HTTP `409` return code is used when a cancelReplace order partially succeeds. (e.g. if the cancellation of the order fails but the new order placement succeeds.)
* HTTP `429` return code is used when breaking a request rate limit.
* HTTP `418` return code is used when an IP has been auto-banned for continuing to send requests after receiving `429` codes.
* HTTP `5XX` return codes are used for internal errors; the issue is on
  Binance's side.
  It is important to **NOT** treat this as a failure operation; the execution status is
  **UNKNOWN** and could have been a success.

### Error Codes and Messages[​](/docs/derivatives/portfolio-margin-pro/general-info#error-codes-and-messages "Direct link to Error Codes and Messages")

* If there is an error, the API will return an error with a message of the reason.

> The error payload on API and SAPI is as follows:

```prism-code
{  
  "code": -1121,  
  "msg": "Invalid symbol."  
}
```

* Specific error codes and messages defined in [Error Codes](/docs/derivatives/portfolio-margin-pro/general-info#error-codes).

### General Information on Endpoints[​](/docs/derivatives/portfolio-margin-pro/general-info#general-information-on-endpoints "Direct link to General Information on Endpoints")

* For `GET` endpoints, parameters must be sent as a `query string`.
* For `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` endpoints, the parameters may be sent as a
  `query string` or in the `request body` with content type
  `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`. You may mix parameters between both the
  `query string` and `request body` if you wish to do so.
* Parameters may be sent in any order.
* If a parameter sent in both the `query string` and `request body`, the
  `query string` parameter will be used.

## LIMITS[​](/docs/derivatives/portfolio-margin-pro/general-info#limits "Direct link to LIMITS")

### General Info on Limits[​](/docs/derivatives/portfolio-margin-pro/general-info#general-info-on-limits "Direct link to General Info on Limits")

* The following `intervalLetter` values for headers:
  + SECOND => S
  + MINUTE => M
  + HOUR => H
  + DAY => D
* `intervalNum` describes the amount of the interval. For example, `intervalNum` 5 with `intervalLetter` M means "Every 5 minutes".
* The `/api/v3/exchangeInfo` `rateLimits` array contains objects related to the exchange's `RAW_REQUESTS`, `REQUEST_WEIGHT`, and `ORDERS` rate limits. These are further defined in the `ENUM definitions` section under `Rate limiters (rateLimitType)`.
* A 429 will be returned when either request rate limit or order rate limit is violated.

### IP Limits[​](/docs/derivatives/portfolio-margin-pro/general-info#ip-limits "Direct link to IP Limits")

* Every request will contain `X-MBX-USED-WEIGHT-(intervalNum)(intervalLetter)` in the response headers which has the current used weight for the IP for all request rate limiters defined.
* Each route has a `weight` which determines for the number of requests each endpoint counts for. Heavier endpoints and endpoints that do operations on multiple symbols will have a heavier `weight`.
* When a 429 is received, it's your obligation as an API to back off and not spam the API.
* **Repeatedly violating rate limits and/or failing to back off after receiving 429s will result in an automated IP ban (HTTP status 418).**
* IP bans are tracked and **scale in duration** for repeat offenders, **from 2 minutes to 3 days**.
* A `Retry-After` header is sent with a 418 or 429 responses and will give the **number of seconds** required to wait, in the case of a 429, to prevent a ban, or, in the case of a 418, until the ban is over.
* **The limits on the API are based on the IPs, not the API keys.**

We recommend using the websocket for getting data as much as possible, as this will not count to the request rate limit.

### Order Rate Limits[​](/docs/derivatives/portfolio-margin-pro/general-info#order-rate-limits "Direct link to Order Rate Limits")

* Every successful order response will contain a `X-MBX-ORDER-COUNT-(intervalNum)(intervalLetter)` header which has the current order count for the account for all order rate limiters defined.
* When the order count exceeds the limit, you will receive a 429 error without the `Retry-After` header. Please check the Order Rate Limit rules using `GET api/v3/exchangeInfo` and wait for reactivation accordingly.
* Rejected/unsuccessful orders are not guaranteed to have `X-MBX-ORDER-COUNT-**` headers in the response.
* **The order rate limit is counted against each account**.
* To monitor order count usage, refer to GET `api/v3/rateLimit/order`

### Websocket Limits[​](/docs/derivatives/portfolio-margin-pro/general-info#websocket-limits "Direct link to Websocket Limits")

* WebSocket connections have a limit of 5 incoming messages per second. A message is considered:
  + A PING frame
  + A PONG frame
  + A JSON controlled message (e.g. subscribe, unsubscribe)
* A connection that goes beyond the limit will be disconnected; IPs that are repeatedly disconnected may be banned.
* A single connection can listen to a maximum of 1024 streams.
* There is a limit of **300 connections per attempt every 5 minutes per IP**.

### /api/ and /sapi/ Limit Introduction[​](/docs/derivatives/portfolio-margin-pro/general-info#api-and-sapi-limit-introduction "Direct link to /api/ and /sapi/ Limit Introduction")

The `/api/*` and `/sapi/*` endpoints adopt either of two access limiting rules, IP limits or UID (account) limits.

* Endpoints related to `/api/*`:

  + According to the two modes of IP and UID (account) limit, each are independent.
  + Endpoints share the 6000 per minute limit based on IP.
  + Responses contain the header `X-MBX-USED-WEIGHT-(intervalNum)(intervalLetter)`, defining the weight used by the current IP.
  + Successful order responses contain the header `X-MBX-ORDER-COUNT-(intervalNum)(intervalLetter)`, defining the order limit used by the UID.
* Endpoints related to `/sapi/*`:

  + Endpoints are marked according to IP or UID limit and their corresponding weight value.
  + Each endpoint with IP limits has an independent 12000 per minute limit.
  + Each endpoint with UID limits has an independent 180000 per minute limit.
  + Responses from endpoints with IP limits contain the header `X-SAPI-USED-IP-WEIGHT-1M`, defining the weight used by the current IP.
  + Responses from endpoints with UID limits contain the header `X-SAPI-USED-UID-WEIGHT-1M`, defining the weight used by the current UID.

---

## Data Sources[​](/docs/derivatives/portfolio-margin-pro/general-info#data-sources "Direct link to Data Sources")

* The API system is asynchronous, so some delay in the response is normal and expected.
* Each endpoint has a data source indicating where the data is being retrieved, and thus which endpoints have the most up-to-date response.

These are the three sources, ordered by which is has the most up-to-date response to the one with potential delays in updates.

* **Matching Engine** - the data is from the matching Engine
* **Memory** - the data is from a server's local or external memory
* **Database** - the data is taken directly from a database

Some endpoints can have more than 1 data source. (e.g. Memory => Database)   
  
This means that the endpoint will check the first Data Source, and if it cannot find the value it's looking for it will check the next one.

## Endpoint security type[​](/docs/derivatives/portfolio-margin-pro/general-info#endpoint-security-type "Direct link to Endpoint security type")

* Each endpoint has a security type that determines how you will
  interact with it. This is stated next to the NAME of the endpoint.
  + If no security type is stated, assume the security type is NONE.
* API-keys are passed into the Rest API via the `X-MBX-APIKEY`
  header.
* API-keys and secret-keys **are case sensitive**.
* API-keys can be configured to only access certain types of secure endpoints.
  For example, one API-key could be used for TRADE only, while another API-key
  can access everything except for TRADE routes.
* By default, API-keys can access all secure routes.

| Security Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| NONE | Endpoint can be accessed freely. |
| TRADE | Endpoint requires sending a valid API-Key and signature. |
| MARGIN | Endpoint requires sending a valid API-Key and signature. |
| USER\_DATA | Endpoint requires sending a valid API-Key and signature. |
| USER\_STREAM | Endpoint requires sending a valid API-Key. |
| MARKET\_DATA | Endpoint requires sending a valid API-Key. |

* `TRADE`, `MARGIN` and `USER_DATA` endpoints are `SIGNED` endpoints.

---

## SIGNED (TRADE, USER\_DATA, AND MARGIN) Endpoint security[​](/docs/derivatives/portfolio-margin-pro/general-info#signed-trade-user_data-and-margin-endpoint-security "Direct link to SIGNED (TRADE, USER_DATA, AND MARGIN) Endpoint security")

* `SIGNED` endpoints require an additional parameter, `signature`, to be
  sent in the `query string` or `request body`.
* Endpoints use `HMAC SHA256` signatures. The `HMAC SHA256 signature` is a keyed `HMAC SHA256` operation.
  Use your `secretKey` as the key and `totalParams` as the value for the HMAC operation.
* The `signature` is **not case sensitive**.
* `totalParams` is defined as the `query string` concatenated with the
  `request body`.

### Timing security[​](/docs/derivatives/portfolio-margin-pro/general-info#timing-security "Direct link to Timing security")

* A `SIGNED` endpoint also requires a parameter, `timestamp`, to be sent which
  should be the millisecond timestamp of when the request was created and sent.
* An additional parameter, `recvWindow`, may be sent to specify the number of
  milliseconds after `timestamp` the request is valid for. If `recvWindow`
  is not sent, **it defaults to 5000**.

> The logic is as follows:

```prism-code
  if (timestamp < (serverTime + 1000) && (serverTime - timestamp) <= recvWindow)  
  {  
    // process request  
  }   
  else   
  {  
    // reject request  
  }
```

**Serious trading is about timing.** Networks can be unstable and unreliable,
which can lead to requests taking varying amounts of time to reach the
servers. With `recvWindow`, you can specify that the request must be
processed within a certain number of milliseconds or be rejected by the
server.

It is recommended to use a small recvWindow of 5000 or less! The max cannot go beyond 60,000!

### SIGNED Endpoint Examples for POST /api/v3/order - HMAC Keys[​](/docs/derivatives/portfolio-margin-pro/general-info#signed-endpoint-examples-for-post-apiv3order---hmac-keys "Direct link to SIGNED Endpoint Examples for POST /api/v3/order - HMAC Keys")

Here is a step-by-step example of how to send a vaild signed payload from the
Linux command line using `echo`, `openssl`, and `curl`.

### SIGNED Endpoint Example for POST /api/v3/order - RSA Keys[​](/docs/derivatives/portfolio-margin-pro/general-info#signed-endpoint-example-for-post-apiv3order---rsa-keys "Direct link to SIGNED Endpoint Example for POST /api/v3/order - RSA Keys")

* This will be a step by step process how to create the signature payload to send a valid signed payload.
* We support `PKCS#8` currently.
* To get your API key, you need to upload your RSA Public Key to your account and a corresponding API key will be provided for you.

For this example, the private key will be referenced as `test-prv-key.pem`

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| apiKey | CAvIjXy3F44yW6Pou5k8Dy1swsYDWJZLeoK2r8G4cFDnE9nosRppc2eKc1T8TRTQ |

| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| symbol | BTCUSDT |
| side | SELL |
| type | LIMIT |
| timeInForce | GTC |
| quantity | 1 |
| price | 0.2 |
| recvWindow | 5000 |
| timestamp | 1668481559918 |

> **Signature payload (with the listed parameters):**

```prism-code
symbol=BTCUSDT&side=SELL&type=LIMIT&timeInForce=GTC&quantity=1&price=0.2&timestamp=1668481559918&recvWindow=5000
```

**Step 1: Construct the payload**

Arrange the list of parameters into a string. Separate each parameter with a `&`.

**Step 2: Compute the signature:**

2.1 - Encode signature payload as ASCII data.

> **Step 2.2**

```prism-code
 $ echo -n 'symbol=BTCUSDT&side=SELL&type=LIMIT&timeInForce=GTC&quantity=1&price=0.2&timestamp=1668481559918&recvWindow=5000' | openssl dgst -sha256 -sign ./test-prv-key.pem
```

2.2 - Sign payload using RSASSA-PKCS1-v1\_5 algorithm with SHA-256 hash function.

> **Step 2.3**

```prism-code
$  echo -n 'symbol=BTCUSDT&side=SELL&type=LIMIT&timeInForce=GTC&quantity=1&price=0.2&timestamp=1668481559918&recvWindow=5000' | openssl dgst -sha256 -sign ./test-prv-key.pem | openssl enc -base64 -A  
HZ8HOjiJ1s/igS9JA+n7+7Ti/ihtkRF5BIWcPIEluJP6tlbFM/Bf44LfZka/iemtahZAZzcO9TnI5uaXh3++lrqtNonCwp6/245UFWkiW1elpgtVAmJPbogcAv6rSlokztAfWk296ZJXzRDYAtzGH0gq7CgSJKfH+XxaCmR0WcvlKjNQnp12/eKXJYO4tDap8UCBLuyxDnR7oJKLHQHJLP0r0EAVOOSIbrFang/1WOq+Jaq4Efc4XpnTgnwlBbWTmhWDR1pvS9iVEzcSYLHT/fNnMRxFc7u+j3qI//5yuGuu14KR0MuQKKCSpViieD+fIti46sxPTsjSemoUKp0oXA==
```

2.3 - Encode output as base64 string.

> **Step 2.4**

```prism-code
HZ8HOjiJ1s%2FigS9JA%2Bn7%2B7Ti%2FihtkRF5BIWcPIEluJP6tlbFM%2FBf44LfZka%2FiemtahZAZzcO9TnI5uaXh3%2B%2BlrqtNonCwp6%2F245UFWkiW1elpgtVAmJPbogcAv6rSlokztAfWk296ZJXzRDYAtzGH0gq7CgSJKfH%2BXxaCmR0WcvlKjNQnp12%2FeKXJYO4tDap8UCBLuyxDnR7oJKLHQHJLP0r0EAVOOSIbrFang%2F1WOq%2BJaq4Efc4XpnTgnwlBbWTmhWDR1pvS9iVEzcSYLHT%2FfNnMRxFc7u%2Bj3qI%2F%2F5yuGuu14KR0MuQKKCSpViieD%2BfIti46sxPTsjSemoUKp0oXA%3D%3D
```

2.4 - Since the signature may contain `/` and `=`, this could cause issues with sending the request. So the signature has to be URL encoded.

> **Step 2.5**

```prism-code
 curl -H "X-MBX-APIKEY: CAvIjXy3F44yW6Pou5k8Dy1swsYDWJZLeoK2r8G4cFDnE9nosRppc2eKc1T8TRTQ" -X POST 'https://api.binance.com/api/v3/order?symbol=BTCUSDT&side=SELL&type=LIMIT&timeInForce=GTC&quantity=1&price=0.2&timestamp=1668481559918recvWindow=5000&signature=HZ8HOjiJ1s%2FigS9JA%2Bn7%2B7Ti%2FihtkRF5BIWcPIEluJP6tlbFM%2FBf44LfZka%2FiemtahZAZzcO9TnI5uaXh3%2B%2BlrqtNonCwp6%2F245UFWkiW1elpgtVAmJPbogcAv6rSlokztAfWk296ZJXzRDYAtzGH0gq7CgSJKfH%2BXxaCmR0WcvlKjNQnp12%2FeKXJYO4tDap8UCBLuyxDnR7oJKLHQHJLP0r0EAVOOSIbrFang%2F1WOq%2BJaq4Efc4XpnTgnwlBbWTmhWDR1pvS9iVEzcSYLHT%2FfNnMRxFc7u%2Bj3qI%2F%2F5yuGuu14KR0MuQKKCSpViieD%2BfIti46sxPTsjSemoUKp0oXA%3D%3D'
```

2.5 - curl command

> **Bash script**

```prism-code
#!/usr/bin/env bash  
  
# Set up authentication:  
API_KEY="put your own API Key here"  
PRIVATE_KEY_PATH="test-prv-key.pem"
