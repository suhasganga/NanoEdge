# Filters

Filters define trading rules on a symbol or an exchange.

## Symbol filters[​](/docs/derivatives/coin-margined-futures/common-definition#symbol-filters "Direct link to Symbol filters")

### PRICE\_FILTER[​](/docs/derivatives/coin-margined-futures/common-definition#price_filter "Direct link to PRICE_FILTER")

> **/exchangeInfo format:**

```prism-code
  {  
    "filterType": "PRICE_FILTER",  
    "minPrice": "0.00000100",  
    "maxPrice": "100000.00000000",  
    "tickSize": "0.00000100"  
  }
```

The `PRICE_FILTER` defines the `price` rules for a symbol. There are 3 parts:

* `minPrice` defines the minimum `price`/`stopPrice` allowed; disabled on `minPrice` == 0.
* `maxPrice` defines the maximum `price`/`stopPrice` allowed; disabled on `maxPrice` == 0.
* `tickSize` defines the intervals that a `price`/`stopPrice` can be increased/decreased by; disabled on `tickSize` == 0.

Any of the above variables can be set to 0, which disables that rule in the `price filter`. In order to pass the `price filter`, the following must be true for `price`/`stopPrice` of the enabled rules:

* `price` >= `minPrice`
* `price` <= `maxPrice`
* (`price`-`minPrice`) % `tickSize` == 0

### LOT\_SIZE[​](/docs/derivatives/coin-margined-futures/common-definition#lot_size "Direct link to LOT_SIZE")

> **/exchangeInfo format:**

```prism-code
  {  
    "filterType": "LOT_SIZE",  
    "minQty": "0.00100000",  
    "maxQty": "100000.00000000",  
    "stepSize": "0.00100000"  
  }
```

The `LOT_SIZE` filter defines the `quantity` (aka "lots" in auction terms) rules for a symbol. There are 3 parts:

* `minQty` defines the minimum `quantity` allowed.
* `maxQty` defines the maximum `quantity` allowed.
* `stepSize` defines the intervals that a `quantity` can be increased/decreased by.

In order to pass the `lot size`, the following must be true for `quantity`:

* `quantity` >= `minQty`
* `quantity` <= `maxQty`
* (`quantity`-`minQty`) % `stepSize` == 0

### MARKET\_LOT\_SIZE[​](/docs/derivatives/coin-margined-futures/common-definition#market_lot_size "Direct link to MARKET_LOT_SIZE")

> **/exchangeInfo format:**

```prism-code
  {  
    "filterType": "MARKET_LOT_SIZE",  
    "minQty": "0.00100000",  
    "maxQty": "100000.00000000",  
    "stepSize": "0.00100000"  
  }
```

The `MARKET_LOT_SIZE` filter defines the `quantity` (aka "lots" in auction terms) rules for `MARKET` orders on a symbol. There are 3 parts:

* `minQty` defines the minimum `quantity` allowed.
* `maxQty` defines the maximum `quantity` allowed.
* `stepSize` defines the intervals that a `quantity` can be increased/decreased by.

In order to pass the `market lot size`, the following must be true for `quantity`:

* `quantity` >= `minQty`
* `quantity` <= `maxQty`
* (`quantity`-`minQty`) % `stepSize` == 0

### MAX\_NUM\_ORDERS[​](/docs/derivatives/coin-margined-futures/common-definition#max_num_orders "Direct link to MAX_NUM_ORDERS")

> **/exchangeInfo format:**

```prism-code
  {  
    "filterType": "MAX_NUM_ORDERS",  
    "limit": 200  
  }
```

The `MAX_NUM_ORDERS` filter defines the maximum number of orders an account is allowed to have open on a symbol.

Note that both "algo" orders and normal orders are counted for this filter.

### PERCENT\_PRICE[​](/docs/derivatives/coin-margined-futures/common-definition#percent_price "Direct link to PERCENT_PRICE")

> **/exchangeInfo format:**

```prism-code
  {  
    "filterType": "PERCENT_PRICE",  
    "multiplierUp": "1.0500",  
    "multiplierDown": "0.9500",  
    "multiplierDecimal": 4  
  }
```

The `PERCENT_PRICE` filter defines valid range for a price based on the mark price.

In order to pass the `percent price`, the following must be true for `price`:

* BUY: `price` <= `markPrice` \* `multiplierUp`
* SELL: `price` >= `markPrice` \* `multiplierDown`
