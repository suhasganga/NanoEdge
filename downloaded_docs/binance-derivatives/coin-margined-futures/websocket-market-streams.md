# Websocket Market Streams

* There are two connection methods for Websocket：

  + Base Url: **wss://dstream.binance.com**
  + Streams can be access either in a single raw stream or a combined stream
  + Raw streams are accessed at **/ws/<streamName>**
  + Combined streams are accessed at **/stream?streams=<streamName1>/<streamName2>/<streamName3>**
  + Example:
  + `wss://dstream.binance.com/ws/bnbusdt@aggTrade`
  + `wss://dstream.binance.com/stream?streams=bnbusdt@aggTrade/btcusdt@markPrice`
* Combined stream events are wrapped as follows: **{"stream":"<streamName>","data":<rawPayload>}**
* All symbols for streams are **lowercase**
* A single connection is only valid for 24 hours; expect to be disconnected at the 24 hour mark
* The websocket server will send a `ping frame` every 3 minutes. If the websocket server does not receive a `pong frame` back from the connection within a 10 minute period, the connection will be disconnected. Unsolicited `pong frames` are allowed(Client can send `pong frames` with frequency higher than 10 minutes).
* WebSocket connections have a limit of 10 incoming messages per second.
* A connection that goes beyond the limit will be disconnected; IPs that are repeatedly disconnected may be banned.
* A single connection can listen to a maximum of **1024** streams.
* Considering the possible data latency from RESTful endpoints during an extremely volatile market, it is highly recommended to get the order status, position, etc from the Websocket user data stream.
