# User Data Streams Connect

* The base API endpoint is: **<https://dapi.binance.com>**
* A User Data Stream `listenKey` is valid for 60 minutes after creation.
* Doing a `PUT` on a `listenKey` will extend its validity for 60 minutes, if response `-1125` error "This listenKey does not exist." Please use `POST /dapi/v1/listenKey` to recreate `listenKey`.
* Doing a `DELETE` on a `listenKey` will close the stream and invalidate the `listenKey`.
* Doing a `POST` on an account with an active `listenKey` will return the currently active `listenKey` and extend its validity for 60 minutes.
* There are two connection methods for Websocket：

  + Base Url 1: **wss://dstream.binance.com**
  + User Data Streams are accessed at **/ws/<listenKey>**
  + Example: `wss://dstream.binance.com/ws/XaEAKTsQSRLZAGH9tuIu37plSRsdjmlAVBoNYPUITlTAko1WI22PgmBMpI1rS8Yh`
  + Base Url 2: **wss://dstream-auth.binance.com**
  + User Data Streams are accessed at **/ws/<listenKey>?listenKey=<validateListenKey>**
  + **<validateListenKey> must be a valid listenKey when you establish a connection**
  + Example:
  + `wss://dstream-auth.binance.com/ws/XaEAKTsQSRLZAGH9tuIu37plSRsdjmlAVBoNYPUITlTAko1WI22PgmBMpI1rS8Yh？listenKey=XaEAKTsQSRLZAGH9tuIu37plSRsdjmlAVBoNYPUITlTAko1WI22PgmBMpI1rS8Yh`
* For one connection(one user data), the user data stream payloads can guaranteed to be in order during heavy periods; **Strongly recommend you order your updates using E**
* A single connection is only valid for 24 hours; expect to be disconnected at the 24 hour mark
