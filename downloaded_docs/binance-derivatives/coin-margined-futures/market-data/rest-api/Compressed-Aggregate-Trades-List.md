> * If `fromId`, `startTime`, and `endTime` are not sent, the most recent aggregate trades will be returned.
> * Only market trades will be aggregated and returned, which means the insurance fund trades and ADL trades won't be aggregated.
> * Sending both `startTime`/`endTime` and `fromId` might cause response timeout, please send either `fromId` or `startTime`/`endTime`
