# User Data Streams Connect

* The base API endpoint is: **<https://fapi.binance.com>**
* A User Data Stream `listenKey` is valid for 60 minutes after creation.
* Doing a `PUT` on a `listenKey` will extend its validity for 60 minutes, if response `-1125` error "This listenKey does not exist." Please use `POST /fapi/v1/listenKey` to recreate `listenKey`.
* Doing a `DELETE` on a `listenKey` will close the stream and invalidate the `listenKey`.
* Doing a `POST` on an account with an active `listenKey` will return the currently active `listenKey` and extend its validity for 60 minutes.
