# Position ADL Quantile Estimation(USER\_DATA)

## API Description[​](/docs/derivatives/usds-margined-futures/trade/rest-api/Position-ADL-Quantile-Estimation#api-description "Direct link to API Description")

Position ADL Quantile Estimation

> * Values update every 30s.
> * Values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 shows the queue position and possibility of ADL from low to high.
> * For positions of the symbol are in One-way Mode or isolated margined in Hedge Mode, "LONG", "SHORT", and "BOTH" will be returned to show the positions' adl quantiles of different position sides.
> * If the positions of the symbol are crossed margined in Hedge Mode:
>   + "HEDGE" as a sign will be returned instead of "BOTH";
>   + A same value caculated on unrealized pnls on long and short sides' positions will be shown for "LONG" and "SHORT" when there are positions in both of long and short sides.
