# Event: Balance and Position Update

## Event Description[​](/docs/derivatives/usds-margined-futures/user-data-streams/Event-Balance-and-Position-Update#event-description "Direct link to Event Description")

Event type is `ACCOUNT_UPDATE`.

* When balance or position get updated, this event will be pushed.

  + `ACCOUNT_UPDATE` will be pushed only when update happens on user's account, including changes on balances, positions, or margin type.
  + Unfilled orders or cancelled orders will not make the event `ACCOUNT_UPDATE` pushed, since there's no change on positions.
  + "position" in `ACCOUNT_UPDATE`: Only symbols of changed positions will be pushed.
* When "FUNDING FEE" changes to the user's balance, the event will be pushed with the brief message:

  + When "FUNDING FEE" occurs in a **crossed position**, `ACCOUNT_UPDATE` will be pushed with only the balance `B`(including the "FUNDING FEE" asset only), without any position `P` message.
  + When "FUNDING FEE" occurs in an **isolated position**, `ACCOUNT_UPDATE` will be pushed with only the balance `B`(including the "FUNDING FEE" asset only) and the relative position message `P`( including the isolated position on which the "FUNDING FEE" occurs only, without any other position message).
* The field "m" represents the reason type for the event and may shows the following possible types:

  + DEPOSIT
  + WITHDRAW
  + ORDER
  + FUNDING\_FEE
  + WITHDRAW\_REJECT
  + ADJUSTMENT
  + INSURANCE\_CLEAR
  + ADMIN\_DEPOSIT

  + ASSET\_TRANSFER
  + OPTIONS\_PREMIUM\_FEE
  + OPTIONS\_SETTLE\_PROFIT
