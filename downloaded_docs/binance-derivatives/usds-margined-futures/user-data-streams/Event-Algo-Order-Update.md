# Event: Algo Order Update

## Event Description[​](/docs/derivatives/usds-margined-futures/user-data-streams/Event-Algo-Order-Update#event-description "Direct link to Event Description")

When new algo order created, order status changed will push such event.
event type is `ALGO_UPDATE`.

**Algo Status**

* `NEW`: This status indicates that the conditional order was successfully placed into the Algo Service but has not yet been triggered.
* `CANCELED`: This status signifies that the conditional order has been canceled.
* `TRIGGERING`: This status suggests that the order has met the triggering condition and has been forwarded to the matching engine.
* `TRIGGERED`: This status means that the order has been successfully placed into the matching engine.
* `FINISHED`: This status shows that the triggered conditional order has been filled or canceled in the matching engine.
* `REJECTED`: This status signifies that the conditional order has been denied by the matching engine, such as in scenarios of margin check failures.
* `EXPIRED`: This status denotes that the conditional order has been canceled by the system. An example would be when a user places a GTE\_GTC Time-In-Force conditional order but then closes all positions on that symbol, resulting in system-led cancellation of the conditional order.
