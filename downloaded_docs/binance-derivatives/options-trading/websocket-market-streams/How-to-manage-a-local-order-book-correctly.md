# How to manage a local order book correctly

1. Open a stream to **wss://fstream.binance.com/public/stream?streams=btc-200630-9000-p@depth@100ms**.
2. Buffer the events you receive from the stream. For same price, latest received update covers the previous one.
3. Get a depth snapshot from **<https://eapi.binance.com/eapi/v1/depth?symbol=btc-200630-9000-p&limit=1000>** .
4. Drop any event where `u` is < `lastUpdateId` in the snapshot.
5. The first processed event should have `U` ``` <= ``lastUpdateId ``` **AND** `u` >``` = ``lastUpdateId ```

* U = firstUpdateId (the first update ID) from the WebSocket stream.
* u = finalUpdateId (the last update ID) from the WebSocket stream.
* lastUpdateId = the update ID you got from the REST depth snapshot.

6. While listening to the stream, each new event's `pu` should be equal to the previous event's `u`, otherwise initialize the process from step 3.ß
7. The data in each event is the **absolute** quantity for a price level.
8. If the quantity is 0, **remove** the price level.
9. Receiving an event that removes a price level that is not in your local order book can happen and is normal.
