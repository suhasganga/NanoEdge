* The baseurl of the websocket interface is: \*\*wss://fstream.binance.com/public/ \*\* or \*\*/ **wss://fstream.binance.com/market/**
* Streams can be access either in a single raw stream or a combined stream
* Raw streams are accessed at **/ws/<streamName>**
* Combined streams are accessed at **/stream?streams=<streamName1>/<streamName2>/<streamName3>**
* Example:

  + `wss://fstream.binance.com/public/ws/btc-210630-9000-p@ticker`
  + `wss://fstream.binance.com/market/stream?streams=btc-210630-9000-p@markPriceoptionMarkPrice`
* A single connection is only valid for 24 hours; expect to be disconnected at the 24 hour mark
* The websocket server will send a `ping frame` every 5 minutes. If the websocket server does not receive a `pong frame` back from the connection within a 15 minute period, the connection will be disconnected. Unsolicited `pong frames` are allowed.
* WebSocket connections have a limit of 10 incoming messages per second.
* A connection that goes beyond the limit will be disconnected; IPs that are repeatedly disconnected may be banned.
* A single connection can listen to a maximum of **200** streams.
* Considering the possible data latency from RESTful endpoints during an extremely volatile market, it is highly recommended to get the order status, position, etc from the Websocket user data stream.
* Combined stream events are wrapped as follows: **{"stream":"<streamName>","data":<rawPayload>}**
* All symbols for streams are **lowercase**
