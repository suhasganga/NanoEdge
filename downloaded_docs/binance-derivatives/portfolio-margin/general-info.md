# General Info

## General API Information[​](/docs/derivatives/portfolio-margin/general-info#general-api-information "Direct link to General API Information")

* The base endpoint is: **<https://papi.binance.com>**
* All endpoints return either a JSON object or raw primitive.
* Data is returned in ascending order. Oldest first, newest last.
* All time and timestamp related fields are in UTC milliseconds.
* All data types adopt definition in JAVA.

### HTTP Return Codes[​](/docs/derivatives/portfolio-margin/general-info#http-return-codes "Direct link to HTTP Return Codes")

* HTTP `4XX` return codes are used for for malformed requests; the issue is on the sender's side.
* HTTP `403` return code is used when the WAF Limit (Web Application Firewall) has been violated.
* HTTP `429` return code is used when breaking a request rate limit.
* HTTP `418` return code is used when an IP has been auto-banned for continuing to send requests after receiving `429` codes.
* HTTP `5XX` return codes are used for internal errors; the issue is on Binance's side.
  1. If there is an error message "Request occur unknown error.", please retry later.
* HTTP `503` return code is used when:
  1. If there is an error message "Unknown error, please check your request or try again later." returned in the response, the API successfully sent the request but not get a response within the timeout period.It is important to NOT treat this as a failure operation; the execution status is UNKNOWN and could have been a success;
  2. If there is an error message "Service Unavailable." returned in the response, it means this is a failure API operation and the service might be unavailable at the moment, you need to retry later.
  3. If there is an error message "Internal error; unable to process your request. Please try again." returned in the response, it means this is a failure API operation and you can resend your request if you need.
  4. If the response contains the error message **"Request throttled by system-level protection. Reduce-only/close-position orders are exempt. Please try again." (-1008)**, This indicates the node has exceeded its maximum concurrency and is temporarily throttled. Close-position, reduce-only, and cancel orders are exempt and will not receive this error.

### HTTP 503 Status: Message Variants & Handling[​](/docs/derivatives/portfolio-margin/general-info#http-503-status-message-variants--handling "Direct link to HTTP 503 Status: Message Variants & Handling")

---

#### A. “Unknown error, please check your request or try again later.” (Execution status **unknown**)[​](/docs/derivatives/portfolio-margin/general-info#a-unknown-error-please-check-your-request-or-try-again-later-execution-status-unknown "Direct link to a-unknown-error-please-check-your-request-or-try-again-later-execution-status-unknown")

* **Meaning**: Request accepted but no response before timeout; **execution may have succeeded**.
* **Handling**:
  + **Do not treat as immediate failure**; first verify via **WebSocket updates** or **orderId queries** to avoid duplicates.
  + During peaks, prefer **single orders** over batch to reduce uncertainty.
* **Rate-limit counting**: **May or may not** count, check header to verify rate limit info

---

#### B. “Service Unavailable.” (Failure)[​](/docs/derivatives/portfolio-margin/general-info#b-service-unavailable-failure "Direct link to B. “Service Unavailable.” (Failure)")

* **Meaning**: Service temporarily unavailable; **100% failure**.
* **Handling**: **Retry with exponential backoff** (e.g., 200ms → 400ms → 800ms, max 3–5 attempts).
* **Rate-limit counting**: **not counted**

---

##### C. “Request throttled by system-level protection. Reduce-only/close-position orders are exempt. Please try again.” (**-1008**, Failure)[​](/docs/derivatives/portfolio-margin/general-info#c-request-throttled-by-system-level-protection-reduce-onlyclose-position-orders-are-exempt-please-try-again--1008-failure "Direct link to c-request-throttled-by-system-level-protection-reduce-onlyclose-position-orders-are-exempt-please-try-again--1008-failure")

* **Meaning**: System overload; **100% failure**.
* **Handling**: **Retry with backoff** and **reduce concurrency**;
* **Applicable endpoints**:
  + `POST /fapi/v1/order` / `POST /dapi/v1/order` / `POST /papi/v1/order`
  + `POST /fapi/v1/batchOrders` / `POST /dapi/v1/batchOrders` / `POST papi/v1/batchOrders`
* **Rate-limit counting**: **Not counted** (overload protection).
* **Exception integrated here**: When a request **reduces exposure** (Reduce-only / Close-position: `closePosition = true`, or `positionSide = BOTH` with `reduceOnly = true`, or `LONG+SELL`, or `SHORT+BUY`), it is **not affected or prioritized under -1008** to ensure risk reduction.
  + Covered endpoints: `POST /fapi/v1/order`、`POST /dapi/v1/order`、`POST /papi/v1/order`、`POST /fapi/v1/batchOrders`、`POST /dapi/v1/batchOrders`、`POST /papi/v1/batchOrders` (when parameters satisfy the condition)

### Error Codes and Messages[​](/docs/derivatives/portfolio-margin/general-info#error-codes-and-messages "Direct link to Error Codes and Messages")

* Any endpoint can return an ERROR
* Specific error codes and messages defined in Error Codes.

### General Information on Endpoints[​](/docs/derivatives/portfolio-margin/general-info#general-information-on-endpoints "Direct link to General Information on Endpoints")

* For `GET` endpoints, parameters must be sent as a `query string`.
* For `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` endpoints, the parameters may be sent as a `query string` or in the `request body` with content type `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`. You may mix parameters between both the `query string` and `request body` if you wish to do so.
* Parameters may be sent in any order.
* If a parameter sent in both the `query string` and `request body`, the `query string` parameter will be used.

## LIMITS[​](/docs/derivatives/portfolio-margin/general-info#limits "Direct link to LIMITS")

* A `429` will be returned when either rate limit is violated.

Binance has the right to further tighten the rate limits on users with intent to attack.

### IP Limits[​](/docs/derivatives/portfolio-margin/general-info#ip-limits "Direct link to IP Limits")

* Every request will contain `X-MBX-USED-WEIGHT-(intervalNum)(intervalLetter)` in the response headers which has the current used weight for the IP for all request rate limiters defined.
* Each route has a `weight` which determines for the number of requests each endpoint counts for. Heavier endpoints and endpoints that do operations on multiple symbols will have a heavier `weight`.
* When a `429` is received, it's your obligation as an API to back off and not spam the API.
* **Repeatedly violating rate limits and/or failing to back off after receiving 429s will result in an automated IP ban (HTTP status 418).**
* IP bans are tracked and **scale in duration** for repeat offenders, **from 2 minutes to 3 days**.
* **The limits on the API are based on the IPs, not the API keys.**
* Portfolio Margin IP Limit is 6000/min.

It is strongly recommended to use websocket stream for getting data as much as possible, which can not only ensure the timeliness of the message, but also reduce the access restriction pressure caused by the request.

### Order Rate Limits[​](/docs/derivatives/portfolio-margin/general-info#order-rate-limits "Direct link to Order Rate Limits")

* Every order response will contain a `X-MBX-ORDER-COUNT-(intervalNum)(intervalLetter)` header which has the current order count for the account for all order rate limiters defined.
* Rejected/unsuccessful orders are not guaranteed to have `X-MBX-ORDER-COUNT-**` headers in the response.
* **The order rate limit is counted against each account**.
* Portfolio Margin Order Limits are 1200/min.

## Endpoint Security Type[​](/docs/derivatives/portfolio-margin/general-info#endpoint-security-type "Direct link to Endpoint Security Type")

* Each endpoint has a security type that determines the how you will interact with it.
* API-keys are passed into the Rest API via the `X-MBX-APIKEY` header.
* API-keys and secret-keys are **case sensitive**.
* API-keys can be configured to only access certain types of secure endpoints. For example, one API-key could be used for TRADE only, while another API-key can access everything except for TRADE routes.
* By default, API-keys can access all secure routes.

| Security Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| NONE | Endpoint can be accessed freely. |
| TRADE | Endpoint requires sending a valid API-Key and signature. |
| USER\_DATA | Endpoint requires sending a valid API-Key and signature. |
| USER\_STREAM | Endpoint requires sending a valid API-Key and signature. |

## SIGNED (TRADE and USER\_DATA) Endpoint Security[​](/docs/derivatives/portfolio-margin/general-info#signed-trade-and-user_data-endpoint-security "Direct link to SIGNED (TRADE and USER_DATA) Endpoint Security")

* `SIGNED` endpoints require an additional parameter, signature, to be sent in the `query string` or `request body`.
* Endpoints use `HMAC SHA256` signatures. The `HMAC SHA256` signature is a keyed `HMAC SHA256` operation. Use your `secretKey` as the key and `totalParams` as the value for the HMAC operation.
* The `signature` is not case sensitive.
* Please make sure the `signature` is the end part of your `query string` or `request body`.
* `totalParam`s is defined as the `query string` concatenated with the `request body`.

### Timing security[​](/docs/derivatives/portfolio-margin/general-info#timing-security "Direct link to Timing security")

* A `SIGNED` endpoint also requires a parameter, `timestamp`, to be sent which should be the millisecond timestamp of when the request was created and sent.
* An additional parameter, `recvWindow`, may be sent to specify the number of milliseconds after `timestamp` the request is valid for. If `recvWindow` is not sent, **it defaults to 5000**. `recvWindow` cannot exceed 60000.
* If the server determines that the timestamp sent by the client is more than one second in the future of the server time, the request will also be rejected.

**Serious trading is about timing.** Networks can be unstable and unreliable, which can lead to requests taking varying amounts of time to reach the servers. With `recvWindow`, you can specify that the request must be processed within a certain number of milliseconds or be rejected by the server.

It is recommended to use a small recvWindow of 5000 or less! The max cannot go beyond 60,000!

### SIGNED Endpoint Examples for POST /papi/v1/um/order[​](/docs/derivatives/portfolio-margin/general-info#signed-endpoint-examples-for-post-papiv1umorder "Direct link to SIGNED Endpoint Examples for POST /papi/v1/um/order")

### RSA Keys - SIGNED Endpoint Examples for POST /papi/v1/um/order[​](/docs/derivatives/portfolio-margin/general-info#rsa-keys---signed-endpoint-examples-for-post-papiv1umorder "Direct link to RSA Keys - SIGNED Endpoint Examples for POST /papi/v1/um/order")

* This will be a step by step process how to create the signature payload to send a valid signed payload.
* We support `PKCS#8` currently.
* To get your API key, you need to upload your RSA Public Key to your account and a corresponding API key will be provided for you.

For this example, the private key will be referenced as `test-prv-key.pem`

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| apiKey | vE3BDAL1gP1UaexugRLtteaAHg3UO8Nza20uexEuW1Kh3tVwQfFHdAiyjjY428o2 |

| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| symbol | BTCUSDT |
| side | BUY |
| type | LIMIT |
| timeInForce | GTC |
| quantity | 1 |
| price | 2000 |
| recvWindow | 5000 |
| timestamp | 1611825601400 |

**Step 1: Construct the payload**

Arrange the list of parameters into a string. Separate each parameter with a `&`.

**Step 2: Compute the signature:**

2.1 - Encode signature payload as ASCII data.

> **Step 2.2**

```prism-code
 $ echo -n 'timestamp=1671090801999&recvWindow=9999999&symbol=BTCUSDT&side=SELL&type=MARKET&quantity=1.23' | openssl dgst -keyform PEM -sha256 -sign ./test-prv-key.pem
```

2.2 - Sign payload using RSASSA-PKCS1-v1\_5 algorithm with SHA-256 hash function.

> **Step 2.3**

```prism-code
$ echo -n 'timestamp=1671090801999&recvWindow=9999999&symbol=BTCUSDT&side=SELL&type=MARKET&quantity=1.23' | openssl dgst -keyform PEM -sha256 -sign ./test-prv-key.pem | openssl enc -base64  
aap36wD5loVXizxvvPI3wz9Cjqwmb3KVbxoym0XeWG1jZq8umqrnSk8H8dkLQeySjgVY91Ufs%2BBGCW%2B4sZjQEpgAfjM76riNxjlD3coGGEsPsT2lG39R%2F1q72zpDs8pYcQ4A692NgHO1zXcgScTGgdkjp%2Brp2bcddKjyz5XBrBM%3D
```

2.3 - Encode output as base64 string.

> **Step 2.4**

```prism-code
$  echo -n 'timestamp=1671090801999&recvWindow=9999999&symbol=BTCUSDT&side=SELL&type=MARKET&quantity=1.23' | openssl dgst -keyform PEM -sha256 -sign ./test-prv-key.pem | openssl enc -base64 | tr -d '\n'  
aap36wD5loVXizxvvPI3wz9Cjqwmb3KVbxoym0XeWG1jZq8umqrnSk8H8dkLQeySjgVY91Ufs%2BBGCW%2B4sZjQEpgAfjM76riNxjlD3coGGEsPsT2lG39R%2F1q72zpDs8pYcQ4A692NgHO1zXcgScTGgdkjp%2Brp2bcddKjyz5XBrBM%3D
```

2.4 - Delete any newlines in the signature.

> **Step 2.5**

```prism-code
aap36wD5loVXizxvvPI3wz9Cjqwmb3KVbxoym0XeWG1jZq8umqrnSk8H8dkLQeySjgVY91Ufs%2BBGCW%2B4sZjQEpgAfjM76riNxjlD3coGGEsPsT2lG39R%2F1q72zpDs8pYcQ4A692NgHO1zXcgScTGgdkjp%2Brp2bcddKjyz5XBrBM%3D
```

2.5 - Since the signature may contain `/` and `=`, this could cause issues with sending the request. So the signature has to be URL encoded.

> **Step 2.6**

```prism-code
 curl -H "X-MBX-APIKEY: vE3BDAL1gP1UaexugRLtteaAHg3UO8Nza20uexEuW1Kh3tVwQfFHdAiyjjY428o2" -X POST 'https://papi.binance.com/papi/v1/um/order?timestamp=1671090801999&recvWindow=9999999&symbol=BTCUSDT&side=SELL&type=MARKET&quantity=1.23&signature=aap36wD5loVXizxvvPI3wz9Cjqwmb3KVbxoym0XeWG1jZq8umqrnSk8H8dkLQeySjgVY91Ufs%2BBGCW%2B4sZjQEpgAfjM76riNxjlD3coGGEsPsT2lG39R%2F1q72zpDs8pYcQ4A692NgHO1zXcgScTGgdkjp%2Brp2bcddKjyz5XBrBM%3D'
```

2.6 - curl command

> **Bash script**

```prism-code
