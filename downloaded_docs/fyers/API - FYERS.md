## Best Practices

##### These are the recommended best practises that you should follow while using the APIs

##### 1. Never share your app_secret with anyone

##### 2. Never share your access_token with anyone

##### 3. Do not provide trading permissions unless you want to use the app to place orders

##### 4. Provide a redirect_uri which is in your control rather than a public endpoint such as google.com

##### 5. You should send a random value in the state parameter and verify whether the same value has been returned to you

## OAuth2 - Auth Flow

##### This is a simple OAuth 2 Authentication Flows.

##### This is recommended for applications which have a backend server which can authenticate the second step

##### This is not recommended for Single Page Applications (SPA)

# Order Placement Guide

## Order Placement Guide

##### The order placement process requires you to carefully input several parameters at the time of making the request. There are several validations which are

##### required to be done before sending the request.

## Order Types

##### Limit Order

##### type: 1

##### A limit order allows you to buy or sell an asset at a specific price (limitPrice) or better. It will only be executed at the specified price or lower for a

##### buy order, and at the specified price or higher for a sell order.

##### Sample input:

```
"symbol": "NSE:SBIN-EQ" "qty": 100 "type": 1 "side": 1 "productType": "INTRADAY" "limitPrice": 100 "stopPrice"
```

##### Market Order

##### type: 2

##### A market order allows you to buy or sell an asset at the current market price. The limitPrice and stopPrice should be set to 0, as it is not used in this

##### order type.

##### Sample input:

```
"symbol": "NSE:SBIN-EQ" "qty": 100 "type": 2 "side": 1 "productType": "INTRADAY" "limitPrice": 0 "stopPrice":
```

##### Stop Order / SL-M

##### type: 3

##### A stop order is designed to limit losses on a position. It becomes a market order when the stopPrice is reached. The stopPrice is the trigger price at

##### which the market order will be placed.

##### The stopPrice must not be higher than the Last Traded Price (ltp) for a sell order and not lower than the ltp for a buy order.

##### Sample input:

```
"symbol": "NSE:SBIN-EQ" "qty": 100 "type": 3 "side": 1 "productType": "INTRADAY" "limitPrice": 0 "stopPrice":
```

##### Stop Limit Order / SL-L

##### type: 4

##### A stop-limit order combines features of a stop order and a limit order. It triggers a limit order once the stopPrice is reached.

##### The stopPrice must not be higher than the Last Traded Price (ltp) for a sell order and not lower than the ltp for a buy order.

##### The stopPrice must be lower than the limitPrice for a buy order and higher than the limitPrice for a sell order.

##### Sample input:

```
"symbol": "NSE:SBIN-EQ" "qty": 100 "type": 4 "side": 1 "productType": "INTRADAY" "limitPrice": 100 "stopPrice"
```

## Product Types

##### Intraday

##### Used to place orders which will be bought and sold the same day

##### Order type can be anything (Market, Limit, Stop, and Stop Limit)

##### CNC

##### Used to place orders only in stocks which will be carried forward

##### Order type can be anything (Market, Limit, Stop, and Stop Limit)

##### Margin

##### Used to place orders in derivative contracts which will be carried forward

##### Order type can be anything (Market, Limit, Stop, and Stop Limit)

##### Cover Order (CO)

##### stopLoss is a mandatory input

##### stopLoss price is given in points denominated. (Eg: SBIN LTP = 300. For the above example, for buy CO, if you want to put stop loss as 298 then

##### you have to pass "stopLoss" value as 2 (difference between ltp and your desired stop loss) )

##### Note:

##### 1. "stopLoss" value can be float but should be multiple of 0.0500.

##### 2. Now let's say if you don't provide stopLoss value as multiple of 0.0500 then you can find this error message {'code': -50, 'message': 'StopLoss

##### not a multiple of tick size 0.0500', 's': 'error'}

##### The order type can be either market or limit (If the market order, then the stop loss price should not be higher than the ltp in buy and lower than the

##### ltp for sell. If the limit order, then the stop loss price should not be higher than the limit price in buy and lower than the limit for sell)

##### Validity should be “DAY.”

##### Disclosed quantity should be 0.

##### Bracket Order (BO)

##### stopLoss is a mandatory input

##### takeProfit is a mandatory input

##### The stopLoss and takeProfit are denominated in rupees above and below the trade price. (Eg: SBIN LTP = 300. So the user can give a target of

##### Rs. 10 and stop loss or Rs. 5.)

##### Order type can be either market, limit, stop, or stop limit

##### Validity should be “DAY.”

##### Disclosed quantity should be 0

##### Margin Trading Facility (MTF)

##### This order type is for placing trades with additional margin.

##### MTF orders require activation.

##### Only stocks from the approved MTF list are allowed.

##### Supported order types: Market, Limit, Stop, and Stop Limit.

## Price Validations

##### For all transaction requests (Order placement / modification), the price input should be in accordance with the exchange provided tick size for the particular

##### symbol.

##### Tick size is applicable for all price inputs (Limit / stop / stopLoss / target)

##### Each symbol will have its own tick size

##### All price inputs have to be in multiples of the tick size

##### The tick size is available in the symbol master

## Quantity Validations

##### For all transaction requests (Order placement / modification), the quantity input should be in accordance with the exchange provided minimum lot size.

##### Segment Minimum Quantity Details

##### Equities The quantity will be in multiples of 1

##### Ordertag string should not exceed length of 30 characters and should have minimum length of 1 character.

##### Ordertag string cannot be your clientID or string Untagged.

##### Ordertagging is currently not supported for ProductType BO & CO. Orders with ordertag for CO/BO product Type will be rejeceted.

## Auto-Order Slice

##### Use the auto-slice feature to place large orders that exceed the exchange’s freeze-quantity limits.

##### Enable it by setting "isSliceOrder": true in the order request. When enabled, the system automatically splits the order into smaller quantities based on the

##### applicable freeze limit. Each slice is submitted as a separate order with its own "Order ID".

##### Note:

##### Slicing is only allowed for NSE CM, NFO and BFO.

##### Maximum slices per request: 10.

##### Sample input :

```
"symbol": "NSE:BANKNIFTY25NOV58900PE" "qty": 3150 "type": 2 "side": 1 "productType": "MARGIN" "limitPrice": 0 "st

##### To Handle partial Candle

##### To receive completed candle data, it is important to send a timestamp that comes before the current minute. If you send a timestamp for the current minute,

##### you will receive partial data because the minute is not yet finished. Therefore, it is recommended to always use a "range_to" timestamp of the previous

##### minute to ensure that you receive the completed candle data.

##### Example:

##### Current Time(seconds can be 1-59): 12:10:20 PM

##### Input for history will be:

##### range_from: 12:08:00 PM

##### range_to: Current Time - 1 minute = 12:09:20 PM

##### So you will get 2 candles - 12:08 PM and 12:09 PM candles. This example is for 1-minute candles; for other resolutions, you have to subtract the resolution

##### time from "range_to" to get completed candles only.

##### Limits for History

##### Unlimited number of stocks history data can be downloaded in a day.

##### Up to 100 days of data per request for resolutions of 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45, 60, 120, 180, and 240 minutes. Data is available from July 3, 2017.

##### For 1D resolutions up to 366 days of data per request for 1D (1 day) resolutions.

##### For Seconds Charts the history will be available only for 30-Trading Days

## Option Chain

##### The Optionchain API provides important information about options trading, specifically focusing on strike prices, which are predetermined prices at which an

##### option contract can be exercised. This API offers data for both Call (CE) and Put (PE) options, along with values for index, IndiaVIX (Volatility Index) and

##### available expiry dates. When using the API, you can specify the number of strike prices you're interested in. For example, if you request a strike count of 2,

##### the API will return data for:

##### At-The-Money (ATM) strike: The closest strike price to the current market price.

##### Out-of-The-Money (OTM) strikes: Strike prices higher than the current market price for Calls (CE) and lower than the current market price for Puts

##### (PE). The API will return data for 2 CE and 2 PE OTM strikes.

##### In-The-Money (ITM) strikes: Strike prices lower than the current market price for Calls (CE) and higher than the current market price for Puts (PE). The

##### API will return data for 2 CE and 2 PE ITM strikes.

## Introduction

##### The WebSocket provides a robust method for accessing real-time data or order updates seamlessly and with low latency. It enables developers and users to

##### establish a persistent, bidirectional connection with the server, allowing them to receive continuous updates, such as symbol updates, depth updates or

##### orderupdate. To enhance your experience with our WebSocket, here are some helpful tips and best practices

##### 1. Subscription Limit: You have the flexibility to subscribe up to 5000 data subscriptions simultaneously via WebSocket with latest SDK versions, please

##### refer Change Log. Staying within this limit ensures smooth subscription management without errors.

##### 2. Single Instance: Keep in mind that you can create only one WebSocket connection instance at a time. This approach ensures stability and prevents

##### issues that might arise from multiple concurrent connections.

##### 3. Efficient Thread Management: WebSocket operates on a dedicated thread, allowing it to run independently of your main application thread. This

##### design guarantees that your primary tasks can continue without interruptions from WebSocket operations.

##### 4. Customizable Callback Functions: Tailor your application's behavior using callback functions provided by the WebSocket. These functions empower

##### you to define specific actions for events like data updates or error occurrences.

##### 5. Auto-Reconnect: Enjoy uninterrupted connectivity by enabling automatic reconnection in case of disconnection. Simply set the reconnect parameter to

##### true during WebSocket initialization, ensuring your application can recover without manual intervention.You can set max reconnection count upto 50.

##### 6. Logging to File: If you want to log data to a file, you can set the write_to_file parameter to true. This feature allows you to efficiently save received data

##### to a log file for analysis or archival purposes. The write_to_file function will only work without callback functions.

##### 7. Reconnect Retry: If you want to define dynamic retry count(max 50), you can set the reconnect_retry parameter to int value of number of times you

##### want it to try reconnection.(In case of node fyersdata.autoreconnect(trycount))

## Market Data Lite-Mode

##### The WebSocket API provides a lightweight and efficient "Lite Mode" for receiving only the Last Traded Price (LTP) updates of specific stock symbols. This

##### mode is designed for users who require real-time access to LTP data without the additional overhead of subscribing to other stock data fields. The Lite Mode

##### allows for seamless integration into applications where only the latest stock prices are needed.

## Advanced Configuration

##### The WebSocket queue processing interval is an Optional setting that allows you to customize how frequently data in the subscription queue is handled. By

##### default, this interval is set to 1 millisecond, but it can be adjusted to better suit your application's specific needs and performance preferences.

##### 1. Customizable Interval: You can set the processing interval anywhere between 1ms to 2000ms (2 seconds), giving you flexibility to optimize

##### performance and responsiveness.

##### 2. Dynamic Adjustment: The interval setting can be changed at any time during an active WebSocket session.

##### 3. Performance Optimization: Shorter intervals (1-10ms) are ideal for high-frequency trading scenarios that benefit from rapid data processing, while

##### slightly longer intervals (100-500ms) work well for general market data streaming.

##### 4. Resource Management: You can tune the interval based on how your application handles incoming data, helping to maintain smooth operation across

##### different environments.

```

```

## Introduction

##### The WebSocket API for receiving order, position, trade, price alerts, and EDIS updates is a real-time communication protocol designed to provide seamless

##### access to various critical elements of a trading and EDIS system. This API allows traders and developers to establish a persistent, bidirectional connection

##### with the server, enabling them to receive real-time updates on their orders, current positions, executed trades, price alerts, and EDIS status.

##### This guide provides instructions on integrating the order WebSocket into any programming language.

© Fyers Securities Pvt. Ltd. All Rights Reserved. Terms & Conditions Privacy Policy Support

## Order WebSocket Connection

##### To connect to order websocket, the below two input params are mandate

##### 1. Websocket endpoint : wss://socket.fyers.in/trade/v3

##### 2. Header:

##### Format: < appId:accessToken >

##### Sample header format : 7ABXUX38S-100:eyJ0eXAi****\*\*****qiTnzd2lGwS17s

##### Based on the programming language chosen, respective socket connection libraries can be used.

##### For the reference please find the sample code for socket connection written in Python.

##### Here, we are making a connection with Fyers order websocket with parameters and callback functions on_message, on_error, on_close, on_open, which

##### are required in the Python socket connection library used and would change as per the other programming library used. Sample callback function is shared

##### below.

##### Note : Handle accordingly in your Programming language

##### Connection Response:

##### On Success: Returns the socket object

##### On Failure:

##### Possible Error : Status code 403

##### 1. Error: Handshake status 403 Forbidden -+-+- {'date': 'Tue, 19 Dec 2023 04:46:45 GMT', 'content-length': '0', 'connection': 'keep-alive', 'cf-cache-status':

## Subscribe Method

##### Once the connection is established, it is required to subscribe for required actions to get the data. To subscribe for different actions, create a message data,

##### which would be the string format for json node.

```
message = json dumps "T" "SUB_ORD" "SLIST" action_data "SUB_T" 1
```

##### Json node Params:

##### T : Type: String

##### value: “SUB_ORD” (Fixed)

##### action_data : Type: List/Array

##### Value: ['orders', 'trades', 'positions', 'edis', 'pricealerts', 'login'] Note: Based on the list passed in action_data web_socket data will be received

##### SUB_T : Integer

##### Value: 1 (value 1 is for subscribing and -1 for unsubscribe)

##### Convert the json to string and send this message to socket to subscribe for action_data mentioned

##### Sample Response:

```
'code' 1605 'message' 'Successfully subscribed' 's' 'ok'
```

##### Response from socket on any action triggered

##### Once the subscribed successfully, for any action triggered, data will be received through socket, if any callback function is defined, would receive on

##### function.

##### Response would be string, In node we get as array buffer and in python we string, then it parsed to required format. In another programming language you

##### might get in another format you just have to change in string.

##### Type: string

##### Value: {"orders":{"client_id":"XP0001","exchange":10,"fy_token":"10100000001628","id":"23121800292158","id_fyers":"df013f50-6925-4e2d-ba0f-

##### Note:

##### 1. Above response would be in the string format (In Python ) and arraybuffer (In Node). You have to check in which format you are getting data from

##### websocket as it is dependent on the websocket library for the particular language.

##### 2. Once you get data, you have to change into the string.(if already in string format then no need to change). After that, you have to change this string to

##### JSON. Here you find the following keys as a JSON Key (One of them ) : orders, trades, positions.

##### 3. Now Based on the Key the data is identified, if key is orders it means it is order update message, if key is trades then this message is for trades

##### updates and same for positions updates.

##### 4. In an Fyers SDK the socket raw response is parsed to generate data with required keys and remove the unnecessary keys

##### Parsed Data: {'s': 'ok', 'orders': {'clientId': 'XP03754', 'id': '23121800388066', 'qty': 1, 'remainingQuantity': 1, 'type': 2, 'fyToken': '10100000002705',

## Ping Method

##### To check whether the websocket connection is alive or not, we have to send a periodically “ping” message. If we get a pong from websocket, it means it is

##### alive else dead. Find how we are doing in Python Code.

##### Here there is one while loop with sleep of 10 seconds and we send a “ping” message to websocket to know that websocket is alive or not.

#### Request samples

```
Python
```

```
def __ping self -> None
"""
Sends periodic ping messages to the server to maintain the WebSocket connection.
```

```
The method continuously sends "__ping" messages to the server at a regular interval
as long as the WebSocket connection is active.
```

```
"""
```

```
while
self __ws_object is not None
and self __ws_object sock
and self __ws_object sock connected

# Tick-by-Tick (TBT) Websocket Usage Guide

##### Method Fields Reason

##### Subscribe Method action_data To subscribe for particular actions

##### Subscribe Method "SUB_T": 1 While subscribing to any action

##### UnSubscribe Method "SUB_T": -1 While unsubscribing any action

## Introduction

##### Tick-by-tick data is the most detailed market data, recording every trade and order book update in real-time. Each "tick" includes the price, volume, and

##### timestamp of individual trades, as well as changes to buy and sell orders. This granular data is crucial for analyzing market microstructure, tracking order

##### flow, and developing high-frequency trading strategies.

## Key Points:

##### 1. Available for NFO and NSE Instruments Only

##### Tick-by-tick data is exclusively available only for NFO (NSE Futures & Options) and NSE (Equity) instruments.

##### 2. Data Formats

##### Requests are sent in JSON format.

##### Responses are received in protobuf format (a compact, efficient data format).

##### 3. Incremental Data Updates

##### Instead of sending the full market data repeatedly, the server only sends changes (differences) between the last data packet and the current one.

##### To get the complete picture, users must maintain previous data and apply these changes.

##### The official SDKs provided by Fyers will handle this process automatically.

##### 4. Snapshot Data on New Subscriptions

##### When a user subscribes to tick-by-tick data , the first packet received is a snapshot , containing the full market data at that moment.

##### After this, all subsequent packets only contain updates (differences) that need to be applied to the snapshot for a real-time view.

## Concept of channels

##### With the Tick-by-Tick (TBT) WebSocket, we are introducing the concept of channels. A channel acts as a logical grouping for different subscribed symbols,

##### making it easier to manage data streams efficiently.

#### How Channels Work

##### When subscribing to market data, you need to specify both the symbols and a channel number.

##### Simply subscribing to a channel does not start the data stream—you must also resume the channel to begin receiving updates.

#### Example Usage

##### Let’s say you organize your subscriptions as follows:

##### Channel 1: All Nifty-related symbols

##### Channel 2: All BankNifty-related symbols

##### Now, depending on what data you need, you can control the channels dynamically:

##### To receive only Nifty data → Pause Channel 2 and Resume Channel 1

##### To receive only BankNifty data → Pause Channel 1 and Resume Channel 2

##### To receive both Nifty and BankNifty data → Resume both channels

##### This approach provides greater flexibility and control over market data streaming, allowing you to filter and manage real-time data efficiently.

## Response Message Types

##### We use Protocol Buffers (protobuf) as the response format for all market data. The .proto file, which defines the data structure, is available at:

##### 📌 Proto URL: https://public.fyers.in/tbtproto/1.0.0/msg.proto

##### Protobuf is a widely used data format, and compilers are available to generate code in different programming languages.

##### How to Install and Use Protobuf

##### Protobuf Compiler Installation: https://protobuf.dev/getting-started/

##### Using Protobuf with Python: https://protobuf.dev/reference/python/python-generated/

##### Using Protobuf with Node.js: https://www.npmjs.com/package/protobufjs

##### We have uploaded the compiled files also for python, nodejs, and golang. You can download the files from the below link:

##### https://public.fyers.in/tbtproto/1.0.0/protogencode.zip

##### Copy the required file directly in your project and use it.
