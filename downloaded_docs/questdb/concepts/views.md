A view is a **virtual table** defined by a SQL `SELECT` statement. Views do not
store data themselves; instead, their defining query is executed as a sub-query
whenever the view is referenced.

## What are views for?[​](#what-are-views-for "Direct link to What are views for?")

Views provide several benefits:

* **Abstraction**: Hide complex queries behind simple table-like interfaces
* **Reusability**: Define queries once, use them everywhere
* **Security**: Control data access without exposing underlying tables
* **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for business logic

Quick example

```prism-code
-- Create a view  
CREATE VIEW hourly_summary AS (  
  SELECT ts, symbol, sum(quantity) as volume  
  FROM trades  
  SAMPLE BY 1h  
);  
  
-- Query the view like a table  
SELECT * FROM hourly_summary WHERE symbol = 'AAPL';
```

## Creating views[​](#creating-views "Direct link to Creating views")

Use `CREATE VIEW` to define a new view:

Basic view

```prism-code
CREATE VIEW daily_prices AS (  
  SELECT ts, symbol, last(price) as closing_price  
  FROM trades  
  SAMPLE BY 1d  
)
```

### CREATE IF NOT EXISTS[​](#create-if-not-exists "Direct link to CREATE IF NOT EXISTS")

To avoid errors when the view already exists:

```prism-code
CREATE VIEW IF NOT EXISTS price_view AS (  
  SELECT symbol, last(price) as price FROM trades SAMPLE BY 1h  
)
```

### CREATE OR REPLACE[​](#create-or-replace "Direct link to CREATE OR REPLACE")

To update an existing view or create it if it doesn't exist:

```prism-code
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW price_view AS (  
  SELECT symbol, last(price) as price, ts FROM trades SAMPLE BY 1h  
)
```

For full syntax details, see
[CREATE VIEW](/docs/query/sql/create-view/).

## Querying views[​](#querying-views "Direct link to Querying views")

Views are queried exactly like tables:

```prism-code
SELECT * FROM my_view  
  
SELECT ts, price FROM my_view WHERE symbol = 'AAPL'  
  
SELECT v1.ts, v2.value  
FROM view1 v1  
JOIN view2 v2 ON v1.id = v2.id
```

### Optimizer transparency[​](#optimizer-transparency "Direct link to Optimizer transparency")

Views in QuestDB are fully transparent to the query optimizer. When you query a
view, the optimizer treats it exactly as if you had written the view's query
inline as a sub-query. This means views benefit from the complete suite of
query optimizations:

* **Filter push-down**: WHERE conditions are pushed to base tables
* **Projection push-down**: Only required columns are read from storage
* **Join optimization**: Join order and strategies are optimized across view boundaries
* **ORDER BY optimization**: Sorting can leverage table indexes
* **Timestamp optimizations**: Time-based operations use partition pruning

```prism-code
-- View definition  
CREATE VIEW trades_view AS (  
  SELECT ts, symbol, price, quantity FROM trades WHERE price > 0  
)  
  
-- This query is optimized as if written inline  
SELECT ts, price FROM trades_view WHERE symbol = 'AAPL' ORDER BY ts  
-- Optimizer sees: SELECT ts, price FROM trades WHERE price > 0 AND symbol = 'AAPL' ORDER BY ts  
-- Only ts and price columns are read, filters applied at scan, ordering uses index
```

Use `EXPLAIN` to see how the optimizer processes view queries:

```prism-code
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM trades_view WHERE symbol = 'AAPL'
```

There is no performance penalty for using views compared to writing equivalent
sub-queries directly.

## Parameterized views[​](#parameterized-views "Direct link to Parameterized views")

Views support the `DECLARE` statement to define parameters with default values.
Use `OVERRIDABLE` to allow users to change parameter values at query time.

### Creating a parameterized view[​](#creating-a-parameterized-view "Direct link to Creating a parameterized view")

```prism-code
CREATE VIEW filtered_trades AS (  
  DECLARE OVERRIDABLE @min_price := 100  
  SELECT ts, symbol, price FROM trades WHERE price >= @min_price  
)
```

### Querying with default parameters[​](#querying-with-default-parameters "Direct link to Querying with default parameters")

```prism-code
SELECT * FROM filtered_trades  
-- Uses default @min_price = 100
```

### Overriding parameters[​](#overriding-parameters "Direct link to Overriding parameters")

```prism-code
DECLARE @min_price := 500 SELECT * FROM filtered_trades  
-- Overrides @min_price to 500
```

### Multiple parameters[​](#multiple-parameters "Direct link to Multiple parameters")

By default, parameters are **non-overridable**. Use `OVERRIDABLE` to allow
override at query time:

```prism-code
CREATE VIEW price_range AS (  
  DECLARE OVERRIDABLE @lo := 100, OVERRIDABLE @hi := 1000  
  SELECT ts, symbol, price FROM trades WHERE price >= @lo AND price <= @hi  
)  
  
-- Query with custom range  
DECLARE @lo := 50, @hi := 200 SELECT * FROM price_range
```

### Non-overridable parameters[​](#non-overridable-parameters "Direct link to Non-overridable parameters")

Parameters without `OVERRIDABLE` cannot be changed at query time, providing
security for sensitive filters:

```prism-code
CREATE VIEW secure_view AS (  
  DECLARE @min_value := 0  
  SELECT * FROM trades WHERE value >= @min_value  
)  
  
-- This will fail with "variable is not overridable: @min_value"  
DECLARE @min_value := -100 SELECT * FROM secure_view
```

### Mixed parameters[​](#mixed-parameters "Direct link to Mixed parameters")

Combine overridable and non-overridable parameters:

```prism-code
CREATE VIEW mixed_params AS (  
  DECLARE @fixed_filter := 'active', OVERRIDABLE @limit := 100  
  SELECT * FROM data WHERE status = @fixed_filter LIMIT @limit  
)  
  
-- @limit can be overridden, @fixed_filter cannot  
DECLARE @limit := 50 SELECT * FROM mixed_params
```

## View hierarchies[​](#view-hierarchies "Direct link to View hierarchies")

Views can reference other views, tables, and materialized views:

```prism-code
-- Level 1: Raw data filtering  
CREATE VIEW valid_trades AS (  
  SELECT * FROM trades WHERE price > 0 AND quantity > 0  
)  
  
-- Level 2: Aggregation  
CREATE VIEW hourly_stats AS (  
  SELECT ts, symbol, sum(quantity) as volume  
  FROM valid_trades  
  SAMPLE BY 1h  
)  
  
-- Level 3: Derived metrics  
CREATE VIEW hourly_vwap AS (  
  SELECT ts, symbol, volume, turnover / volume as vwap  
  FROM hourly_stats  
  WHERE volume > 0  
)
```

tip

Keep view hierarchies shallow (3-4 levels maximum) for better query planning
and maintainability.

## View management[​](#view-management "Direct link to View management")

### Listing views[​](#listing-views "Direct link to Listing views")

```prism-code
SELECT * FROM views()
```

Returns:

| Column | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `view_name` | Name of the view |
| `view_sql` | The SQL definition |
| `view_table_dir_name` | Internal directory name |
| `invalidation_reason` | Error message if view is invalid |
| `view_status` | `valid` or `invalid` |
| `view_status_update_time` | Timestamp of last status change |

### Show view definition[​](#show-view-definition "Direct link to Show view definition")

```prism-code
SHOW CREATE VIEW my_view
```

Returns the `CREATE VIEW` statement that would recreate the view.

### Show view columns[​](#show-view-columns "Direct link to Show view columns")

```prism-code
SHOW COLUMNS FROM my_view
```

### Altering views[​](#altering-views "Direct link to Altering views")

To modify an existing view's definition:

```prism-code
ALTER VIEW my_view AS (SELECT col1, col2 FROM my_table WHERE col1 > 0)
```

For full syntax, see [ALTER VIEW](/docs/query/sql/alter-view/).

### Dropping views[​](#dropping-views "Direct link to Dropping views")

```prism-code
DROP VIEW my_view  
  
-- Or safely:  
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS my_view
```

For full syntax, see [DROP VIEW](/docs/query/sql/drop-view/).

## View invalidation[​](#view-invalidation "Direct link to View invalidation")

Views are automatically invalidated when their dependencies change:

| Operation | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `DROP TABLE` | View becomes invalid |
| `RENAME TABLE` | View becomes invalid |
| `DROP COLUMN` | View becomes invalid if column is referenced |
| `RENAME COLUMN` | View becomes invalid if column is referenced |
| Column type change | View metadata is updated |

### Automatic recovery[​](#automatic-recovery "Direct link to Automatic recovery")

Views are automatically revalidated when the invalidating condition is reversed:

* If a table is dropped and later recreated, dependent views become valid again
* If a column is renamed back to its original name, dependent views become valid
  again

### Checking view status[​](#checking-view-status "Direct link to Checking view status")

```prism-code
SELECT view_name, view_status, invalidation_reason  
FROM views()  
WHERE view_status = 'invalid'
```

## Views in tables() output[​](#views-in-tables-output "Direct link to Views in tables() output")

Views appear in the `tables()` function with `table_type = 'V'`:

```prism-code
SELECT table_name, table_type FROM tables()
```

| table\_type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `T` | Regular table |
| `V` | View |
| `M` | Materialized view |

## Views vs materialized views[​](#views-vs-materialized-views "Direct link to Views vs materialized views")

Understanding when to use each type is important for performance:

| Feature | View | Materialized View |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Data storage | None (virtual) | Physical storage |
| Query execution | On every access | Pre-computed |
| Data freshness | Always current | Depends on refresh |
| Performance | Query-time cost | Read-time benefit |
| Storage cost | Zero | Proportional to result size |

### When to use views[​](#when-to-use-views "Direct link to When to use views")

* Simple transformations that execute quickly
* Data that must always be current
* Ad-hoc analysis where requirements change frequently
* Parameterized queries with `DECLARE`
* Low-frequency queries

### When to use materialized views[​](#when-to-use-materialized-views "Direct link to When to use materialized views")

* Heavy aggregations over large datasets
* Frequently accessed summary data
* Dashboard queries that run repeatedly
* Historical summaries that don't need real-time accuracy

For detailed comparisons and examples, see
[Materialized Views](/docs/concepts/materialized-views/).

## Security with views[​](#security-with-views "Direct link to Security with views")

Views provide a security boundary between users and underlying data.

### Definer security model (Enterprise)[​](#definer-security-model-enterprise "Direct link to Definer security model (Enterprise)")

Views use a **definer security model**. When a view is created, the creator's
permissions are captured. Users querying the view only need `SELECT` permission
on the view itself - they do **not** need permissions on the underlying tables.

```prism-code
-- Admin creates a view on sensitive table  
CREATE VIEW public_summary AS (  
  SELECT date, region, sum(sales) as total FROM sensitive_sales GROUP BY date, region  
);  
  
-- Grant SELECT on the view to analysts  
GRANT SELECT ON public_summary TO analyst_role;  
  
-- Analysts can query the view without access to sensitive_sales  
SELECT * FROM public_summary;  -- Works!  
SELECT * FROM sensitive_sales; -- Access denied!
```

The view's definer permissions are preserved even if the creator's account is
later disabled or deleted.

### No column-level permissions on views[​](#no-column-level-permissions-on-views "Direct link to No column-level permissions on views")

Unlike tables, views do **not** support column-level permissions. You can only
grant or revoke permissions on the entire view:

```prism-code
-- This works: grant SELECT on entire view  
GRANT SELECT ON my_view TO user1;  
  
-- Column-level permissions are NOT supported for views  
-- Use separate views to expose different column subsets
```

To provide different column access to different users, create multiple views
with different column selections.

### Security patterns[​](#security-patterns "Direct link to Security patterns")

Views enable several security patterns:

* **Data subsetting**: Expose only specific rows or columns
* **Column masking**: Hide sensitive columns from certain users
* **Row-level security**: Filter rows based on business rules
* **Aggregation-only access**: Provide summaries without raw data access

### Column-level security example[​](#column-level-security-example "Direct link to Column-level security example")

```prism-code
-- Base table with sensitive data  
CREATE TABLE employees (  
  id LONG,  
  name VARCHAR,  
  salary DOUBLE,        -- Sensitive  
  department VARCHAR,  
  hire_date TIMESTAMP  
);  
  
-- View exposing only non-sensitive columns  
CREATE VIEW employees_public AS (  
  SELECT id, name, department, hire_date  
  FROM employees  
);  
  
-- Grant access to public view only  
GRANT SELECT ON employees_public TO analyst_role;
```

### Row-level security example[​](#row-level-security-example "Direct link to Row-level security example")

```prism-code
-- View for specific trading desk  
CREATE VIEW desk_a_trades AS (  
  SELECT * FROM trades WHERE trader_id IN (101, 102, 103)  
);  
  
GRANT SELECT ON desk_a_trades TO desk_a_users;
```

For more details on permissions, see
[Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](/docs/security/rbac/).

## Performance considerations[​](#performance-considerations "Direct link to Performance considerations")

### Views don't cache results[​](#views-dont-cache-results "Direct link to Views don't cache results")

Every query against a view executes the underlying query. For expensive
aggregations accessed frequently, consider materialized views.

### Optimize with indexes[​](#optimize-with-indexes "Direct link to Optimize with indexes")

Create indexes on base table columns used in view filters:

```prism-code
ALTER TABLE trades ALTER COLUMN symbol ADD INDEX
```

### Check query plans[​](#check-query-plans "Direct link to Check query plans")

Always examine query plans when optimizing:

```prism-code
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM my_view WHERE symbol = 'AAPL'
```

### Best practices[​](#best-practices "Direct link to Best practices")

* Use indexed columns in filters for best performance
* Use parameterized views for common filter patterns
* Avoid deeply nested view hierarchies (>3-4 levels) for maintainability
* Consider materialized views for expensive aggregations that run frequently

## Limitations[​](#limitations "Direct link to Limitations")

1. **No data storage**: Views don't store data - the query runs each time
2. **No indexes**: Views cannot have indexes; filtering relies on underlying
   table indexes
3. **Circular references**: Views cannot reference themselves or create circular
   dependencies
4. **Read-only**: You cannot INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE on views
5. **No DDL operations**: You cannot run DDL operations (like `RENAME TABLE`) on
   views
6. **No column-level permissions**: Unlike tables, you cannot grant permissions
   on individual view columns (Enterprise)
