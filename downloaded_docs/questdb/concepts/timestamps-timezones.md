When working with timestamped data, it may be necessary to convert timestamp
values to or from UTC, or to offset timestamp values by a fixed duration. The
following sections describe how QuestDB handles timestamps natively, how to use
built-in functions for working with time zone conversions, and general hints for
working with time zones in QuestDB.

## Timestamps in QuestDB[​](#timestamps-in-questdb "Direct link to Timestamps in QuestDB")

When using the `timestamp` type, QuestDB will store it as a Unix timestamp in microsecond resolution. Although timestamps in nanoseconds will be parsed, the output will be truncated to microseconds. If the `timestamp_ns` type is used, QuestDB
will store it as a Unix timestamp in nanosecond resolution, and there will be no precision loss. QuestDB does not store time zone information
alongside timestamp values and therefore it should be assumed that all
timestamps are in UTC.

The following example shows how a Unix timestamp in microseconds may be passed
into a timestamp column directly:

```prism-code
CREATE TABLE my_table (ts timestamp, col1 int) timestamp(ts);  
INSERT INTO my_table VALUES(1623167145123456, 12);  
SELECT * FROM my_table;
```

| ts | col1 |
| --- | --- |
| 2021-06-08T15:45:45.123456Z | 12 |

Timestamps may also be inserted as strings in the following way:

```prism-code
INSERT INTO my_table VALUES('2021-06-08T16:45:45.123456Z', 13);  
SELECT * FROM my_table;
```

| ts | col1 |
| --- | --- |
| 2021-06-08T15:45:45.123456Z | 12 |
| 2021-06-08T16:45:45.123456Z | 13 |

When inserting timestamps into a table, it is also possible to use
[timestamp units](/docs/query/functions/date-time/#timestamp-format)
to define the timestamp format, in order to process trailing zeros in exported
data sources such as PostgreSQL:

```prism-code
INSERT INTO my_table VALUES(to_timestamp('2021-06-09T16:45:46.123456789', 'yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.N+'), 14);  
-- Passing 9-digit nanosecond into QuestDB, this is equal to:  
  
INSERT INTO my_table VALUES(to_timestamp('2021-06-10T16:45:46.123456789', 'yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.SSSUUUN'), 14);  
  
SELECT * FROM my_table;
```

The output maintains microsecond resolution:

| ts | col1 |
| --- | --- |
| 2021-06-08T15:45:45.123456Z | 12 |
| 2021-06-08T16:45:45.123456Z | 13 |
| 2021-06-09T16:45:46.123456Z | 14 |

If you want to have nanosecond resolution, you can create the table as

```prism-code
CREATE TABLE my_table (ts timestamp_ns, col1 int) timestamp(ts);
```

If you now insert data with nanosecond precision using any of the methods
seen above, the full nanosecond precision will be retained in the table. Note
we had to use `to_timestamp_ns` rather than `to_timestamp` to get the desired
results.

```prism-code
INSERT INTO my_table VALUES(1623167145123456000, 12);  
INSERT INTO my_table VALUES('2021-06-08T16:45:45.123456123Z', 13);  
INSERT INTO my_table VALUES(to_timestamp_ns('2021-06-09T16:45:46.123456789', 'yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.N+'), 14);  
INSERT INTO my_table VALUES(to_timestamp_ns('2021-06-10T16:45:46.123456789', 'yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.SSSUUUN'), 14);  
  
SELECT * FROM my_table;
```

| ts | col1 |
| --- | --- |
| 2021-06-08T15:45:45.123456000Z | 12 |
| 2021-06-08T16:45:45.123456123Z | 13 |
| 2021-06-09T16:45:46.123456789Z | 14 |
| 2021-06-10T16:45:46.123456789Z | 14 |

## QuestDB's internal time zone database[​](#questdbs-internal-time-zone-database "Direct link to QuestDB's internal time zone database")

In order to simplify working with time zones, QuestDB uses
[the tz time zone database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tz_database) which is
standard in the Java ecosystem. This time zone database is used internally in
time zone lookup and in operations relating to timestamp value conversion to and
from time zones.

For this reason, a time zone may be referenced by abbreviated name, by full time
zone name or by UTC offset:

| Abbreviation | Time zone name | UTC offset |
| --- | --- | --- |
| EST | America/New\_York | -05:00 |

### Referring to time zones[​](#referring-to-time-zones "Direct link to Referring to time zones")

It's strongly advised **not to use the three-letter ID** or abbreviation for
time zones for the following reason:

> The same abbreviation is often used for multiple time zones (for example,
> "CST" could be U.S. "Central Standard Time" and "China Standard Time"), and
> the Java platform can then only recognize one of them

Therefore, choosing a geographic region which observes a time zone
(`"America/New_York"`, `"Europe/Prague"`) or a UTC offset value (`"+02:00"`) is
more reliable when referring to time zones. Instructions for converting to and
from time zones are described in the
[Converting timestamps to and from time zones](#converting-timestamps-to-and-from-time-zones)
section below.

The current QuestDB time zone database uses the **English locale** but support
for additional locales may be added in future. Referring to time zones which are
outdated or not recognized results in a `invalid timezone name` error. The
following resources may be used for hints how to refer to time zones by ID or
offset:

* The [official list maintained by IANA](https://www.iana.org/time-zones)
* Java's
  [getAvailableZoneIds](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/ZoneId.html#getAvailableZoneIds--)
  method
* [Wiki entry on tz database time zones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones)
  (this is a convenient reference, but may not be 100% accurate)

note

Users should be aware that the time zone database contains both **current and
historic transitions** for various time zones. Therefore time zone conversions
must take the historic time zone transitions into account based on the timestamp
values.

### Updates to the time zone database[​](#updates-to-the-time-zone-database "Direct link to Updates to the time zone database")

The upstream project updates past time zones as new information becomes
available. These changes are typically related to daylight saving time (DST)
start and end date transitions and, on rare occasions, time zone name changes.

The tz database version used by QuestDB is determined by the JDK version used at
build time and therefore updates to the time zone database are directly
influenced by this JDK version. To find the JDK version used by a QuestDB build,
run the following SQL:

Get JDK Version[Demo this query](https://demo.questdb.io/?query=SELECT%20build()%3B&executeQuery=true)

```prism-code
SELECT build();
```

| build |
| --- |
| Build Information: QuestDB 7.4.0, JDK 11.0.8, Commit Hash b9776a8a09f7db35955530bff64de488a029f1ce |

## Converting timestamps to and from time zones[​](#converting-timestamps-to-and-from-time-zones "Direct link to Converting timestamps to and from time zones")

For convenience, QuestDB includes two functions for time zone conversions on
timestamp values.

* [to\_timezone()](/docs/query/functions/date-time/#to_timezone)
* [to\_utc()](/docs/query/functions/date-time/#to_utc)

These functions are used to convert a Unix timestamp, or a string equivalent
cast to timestamp as follows:

to\_timezone[Demo this query](https://demo.questdb.io/?query=SELECT%20to_timezone(1623167145000000%2C%20'Europe%2FBerlin')%3B&executeQuery=true)

```prism-code
SELECT to_timezone(1623167145000000, 'Europe/Berlin');
```

| to\_timezone |
| --- |
| 2021-06-08T17:45:45.000000Z |

to\_utc[Demo this query](https://demo.questdb.io/?query=SELECT%20to_utc(1623167145000000%2C%20'Europe%2FBerlin')%3B&executeQuery=true)

```prism-code
SELECT to_utc(1623167145000000, 'Europe/Berlin');
```

| to\_utc |
| --- |
| 2021-06-08T13:45:45.000000Z |

### Using UTC offset for conversions[​](#using-utc-offset-for-conversions "Direct link to Using UTC offset for conversions")

The [to\_timezone()](/docs/query/functions/date-time/#to_timezone) and
[to\_utc()](/docs/query/functions/date-time/#to_utc) functions may use UTC
offset for converting timestamp values. In some cases, this can be more reliable
than string or time zone ID conversion given historic changes to time zone names
or transitions. The following example takes a Unix timestamp in microseconds and
converts it to a time zone `+2` hours offset from UTC:

to\_timezone with Offset[Demo this query](https://demo.questdb.io/?query=SELECT%20to_timezone(1213086329000000%2C%20'%2B02%3A00')%3B&executeQuery=true)

```prism-code
SELECT to_timezone(1213086329000000, '+02:00');
```

| to\_timezone |
| --- |
| 2008-06-10T10:25:29.000000Z |

to\_utc with Offset[Demo this query](https://demo.questdb.io/?query=SELECT%20to_utc('2008-06-10T10%3A25%3A29.000000Z'%2C%20'%2B02%3A00')%3B&executeQuery=true)

```prism-code
SELECT to_utc('2008-06-10T10:25:29.000000Z', '+02:00');
```
