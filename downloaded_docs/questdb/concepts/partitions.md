[Database partitioning](https://questdb.com/glossary/database-partitioning/) is the technique that
splits data in a large database into smaller chunks in order to improve the
performance and scalability of the database system.

QuestDB offers the option to partition tables by intervals of time. Data for
each interval is stored in separate sets of files.

![Diagram of data column files and how they are partitioned to form a table](/docs/images/docs/concepts/partitionModel.webp)

## Properties[​](#properties "Direct link to Properties")

* Partitioning is only possible on tables with a
  [designated timestamp](/docs/concepts/designated-timestamp/).
* Available partition intervals are `NONE`, `YEAR`, `MONTH`, `WEEK`, `DAY`, and
  `HOUR`.
* Partitions are defined at table creation. For more information, refer to the
  [CREATE TABLE section](/docs/query/sql/create-table/).

### Default partitioning by creation method[​](#default-partitioning-by-creation-method "Direct link to Default partitioning by creation method")

| Creation method | Default partition | WAL enabled? | Supports dedup/replication? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SQL `CREATE TABLE` (no `PARTITION BY`) | `NONE` | No | No |
| SQL `CREATE TABLE` (with `PARTITION BY`) | As specified | Yes | Yes |
| ILP auto-created tables | `DAY` | Yes | Yes |

**This difference matters.** Tables without partitioning cannot use WAL, which means
they don't support concurrent writes, deduplication, or replication.

When using SQL, always specify `PARTITION BY` for time-series tables:

```prism-code
CREATE TABLE prices (ts TIMESTAMP, price DOUBLE)  
TIMESTAMP(ts) PARTITION BY DAY;  -- Explicitly partitioned
```

The ILP default (`PARTITION BY DAY`) can be changed via `line.default.partition.by`
in `server.conf`.

### Partition directory naming[​](#partition-directory-naming "Direct link to Partition directory naming")

The naming convention for partition directories is as follows:

| Table Partition | Partition format |
| --- | --- |
| `HOUR` | `YYYY-MM-DDTHH` |
| `DAY` | `YYYY-MM-DD` |
| `WEEK` | `YYYY-Www` |
| `MONTH` | `YYYY-MM` |
| `YEAR` | `YYYY` |

## Advantages of adding time partitions[​](#advantages-of-adding-time-partitions "Direct link to Advantages of adding time partitions")

We recommend partitioning tables to benefit from the following advantages:

* Reducing disk IO for timestamp interval searches. This is because our SQL
  optimizer leverages partitioning.
* Significantly improving calculations and seek times. This is achieved by
  leveraging the chronology and relative immutability of data for previous
  partitions.
* Separating data files physically. This makes it easy to implement file
  retention policies or extract certain intervals.
* Enables out-of-order indexing. Heavily out-of-order commits can
  [split the partitions](#splitting-and-squashing-time-partitions) into parts to
  reduce
  [write amplification](/docs/getting-started/capacity-planning/#write-amplification).

## Checking time partition information[​](#checking-time-partition-information "Direct link to Checking time partition information")

The following SQL keyword and function are implemented to present the partition
information of a table:

* The SQL keyword [SHOW PARTITIONS](/docs/query/sql/show/#show-partitions)
  returns general partition information for the selected table.
* The function [table\_partitions('tableName')](/docs/query/functions/meta/)
  returns the same information as `SHOW PARTITIONS` and can be used in a
  `SELECT` statement to support more complicated queries such as `WHERE`,
  `JOIN`, and `UNION`.

## Splitting and squashing time partitions[​](#splitting-and-squashing-time-partitions "Direct link to Splitting and squashing time partitions")

Heavily out-of-order commits, i.e. commits that contain newer and older
timestamps, can split the partitions into parts to reduce write amplification.
When data is merged into an existing partition as a result of an out-of-order
insert, the partition will be split into two parts: the prefix sub-partition and
the suffix sub-partition.

A partition split happens when both of the following are true:

* The prefix size is bigger than the combination of the suffix and the rows to
  be merged.
* The estimated prefix size on disk is higher than
  `cairo.o3.partition.split.min.size` (50MB by default).

Partition split is iterative and therefore a partition can be split into more
than two parts after several commits. To control the number of parts QuestDB
squashes them together following the following principles:

* For the last (yearly, ..., hourly) partition, its parts are squashed together
  when the number of parts exceeds `cairo.o3.last.partition.max.splits` (20 by
  default).
* For all the partitions except the last one, the QuestDB engine squashes them
  aggressively to maintain only one physical partition at the end of every
  commit.

All partition operations (ALTER TABLE
[ATTACH](/docs/query/sql/alter-table-attach-partition/)/
[DETACH](/docs/query/sql/alter-table-detach-partition/)/
[DROP](/docs/query/sql/alter-table-drop-partition/) PARTITION) do not
consider partition splits as individual partitions and work on the table
partitioning unit (year, week, ..., hour).

For example, when a daily partition consisting of several parts is dropped, all
the parts belonging to the given date are dropped. Similarly, when the multipart
daily partition is detached, it is squashed into a single piece first and then
detached.

### Examples[​](#examples "Direct link to Examples")

For example, Let's consider the following table `x`:

Create Demo Table

```prism-code
CREATE TABLE x AS (  
  SELECT  
    cast(x as int) i,  
    - x j,  
    rnd_str(5, 16, 2) as str,  
    timestamp_sequence('2023-02-04T00', 60 * 1000L) ts  
  FROM long_sequence(60 * 23 * 2 * 1000)  
) timestamp (ts) PARTITION BY DAY WAL;
```

Show Partitions from Demo Table

```prism-code
SHOW PARTITIONS FROM x;
```

| index | partitionBy | name | minTimestamp | maxTimestamp | numRows | diskSize | diskSizeHuman | readOnly | active | attached | detached | attachable |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | DAY | 2023-02-04 | 2023-02-04T00:00:00.000000Z | 2023-02-04T23:59:59.940000Z | 1440000 | 71281136 | 68.0 MiB | FALSE | FALSE | TRUE | FALSE | FALSE |
| 1 | DAY | 2023-02-05 | 2023-02-05T00:00:00.000000Z | 2023-02-05T21:59:59.940000Z | 1320000 | 100663296 | 96.0 MiB | FALSE | TRUE | TRUE | FALSE | FALSE |

Inserting an out-of-order row:

Insert Demo Rows

```prism-code
INSERT INTO x (ts) VALUES ('2023-02-05T21');  
  
SHOW PARTITIONS FROM x;
```

| index | partitionBy | name | minTimestamp | maxTimestamp | numRows | diskSize | diskSizeHuman | readOnly | active | attached | detached | attachable |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | DAY | 2023-02-04 | 2023-02-04T00:00:00.000000Z | 2023-02-04T23:59:59.940000Z | 1440000 | 71281136 | 68.0 MiB | FALSE | FALSE | TRUE | FALSE | FALSE |
| 1 | DAY | 2023-02-05 | 2023-02-05T00:00:00.000000Z | 2023-02-05T20:59:59.880000Z | 1259999 | 65388544 | 62.4 MiB | FALSE | FALSE | TRUE | FALSE | FALSE |
| 2 | DAY | 2023-02-05T205959-880001 | 2023-02-05T20:59:59.940000Z | 2023-02-05T21:59:59.940000Z | 60002 | 83886080 | 80.0 MiB | FALSE | TRUE | TRUE | FALSE | FALSE |

To merge the new partition part back to the main partition for downgrading:

Squash Partitions

```prism-code
ALTER TABLE x SQUASH PARTITIONS;  
  
SHOW PARTITIONS FROM x;
```

| index | partitionBy | name | minTimestamp | maxTimestamp | numRows | diskSize | diskSizeHuman | readOnly | active | attached | detached | attachable |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | DAY | 2023-02-04 | 2023-02-04T00:00:00.000000Z | 2023-02-04T23:59:59.940000Z | 1440000 | 71281136 | 68.0 MiB | FALSE | FALSE | TRUE | FALSE | FALSE |
| 1 | DAY | 2023-02-05 | 2023-02-05T00:00:00.000000Z | 2023-02-05T21:59:59.940000Z | 1320001 | 65388544 | 62.4 MiB | FALSE | TRUE | TRUE | FALSE | FALSE |

## Storage example[​](#storage-example "Direct link to Storage example")

Each partition effectively is a directory on the host machine corresponding to
the partitioning interval. In the example below, we assume a table `trips` that
has been partitioned using `PARTITION BY MONTH`.

```prism-code
[quest-user trips]$ dir  
2017-03     2017-10   2018-05     2019-02  
2017-04     2017-11   2018-06     2019-03  
2017-05     2017-12   2018-07     2019-04  
2017-06     2018-01   2018-08   2019-05  
2017-07     2018-02   2018-09   2019-06  
2017-08     2018-03   2018-10  
2017-09     2018-04   2018-11
```

Each partition on the disk contains the column data files of the corresponding
timestamp interval.

```prism-code
[quest-user 2019-06]$ dir  
_archive    cab_type.v              dropoff_latitude.d     ehail_fee.d  
cab_type.d  congestion_surcharge.d  dropoff_location_id.d  extra.d  
cab_type.k  dropoff_datetime.d      dropoff_longitude.d    fare_amount.d
```
