`SYMBOL` is a data type designed for columns with repetitive string values.
Internally, symbols use dictionary encoding—each unique string is stored once
in a lookup table, and rows store integer references to that table. This is
the same approach used by columnar formats like Parquet and Arrow. The result
is much faster filtering and grouping compared to regular strings.

## When to use SYMBOL[​](#when-to-use-symbol "Direct link to When to use SYMBOL")

Use `SYMBOL` for categorical data with a limited set of repeated values:

* Stock tickers (`AAPL`, `GOOGL`, `MSFT`)
* Country or region codes (`US`, `EU`, `APAC`)
* Status values (`pending`, `completed`, `failed`)
* Device or sensor IDs
* Any column frequently used in `WHERE` or `GROUP BY`

```prism-code
CREATE TABLE trades (  
    timestamp TIMESTAMP,  
    symbol SYMBOL,        -- Good: limited set of tickers  
    side SYMBOL,          -- Good: just BUY/SELL  
    price DOUBLE,  
    quantity DOUBLE  
) TIMESTAMP(timestamp) PARTITION BY DAY;
```

## When to use VARCHAR instead[​](#when-to-use-varchar-instead "Direct link to When to use VARCHAR instead")

Use `VARCHAR` when values are unique or very high cardinality:

* User-generated text (comments, descriptions)
* Log messages
* UUIDs or unique identifiers (consider the `UUID` type instead)
* Columns with hundreds of millions of distinct values

## Why SYMBOL is fast[​](#why-symbol-is-fast "Direct link to Why SYMBOL is fast")

| Operation | VARCHAR | SYMBOL |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Storage | Full string per row | Integer + shared dictionary |
| Filtering (`WHERE symbol = 'X'`) | String comparison | Integer comparison |
| Grouping (`GROUP BY`) | String hashing | Integer grouping |
| Disk usage | Higher | Lower |

Symbols provide:

* **Faster queries** — integer comparisons instead of string operations
* **Lower storage** — strings stored once in a dictionary, rows store integers
* **Index support** — symbol columns can be indexed for even faster lookups

## Creating SYMBOL columns[​](#creating-symbol-columns "Direct link to Creating SYMBOL columns")

```prism-code
CREATE TABLE orders (  
    timestamp TIMESTAMP,  
    symbol SYMBOL,  
    side SYMBOL,  
    order_type SYMBOL,  
    price DOUBLE  
) TIMESTAMP(timestamp) PARTITION BY DAY;
```

Symbol capacity scales automatically as new values are added. No manual
configuration is needed.

Note for users upgrading from versions before 9.0.0

Prior to QuestDB 9.0.0, symbol capacity required manual configuration. You had
to estimate the number of distinct values upfront and set the capacity
explicitly. Undersizing caused performance issues; oversizing wasted memory.

From 9.0.0 onwards, symbol capacity is fully automatic. The `CAPACITY` setting
is now obsolete and can be removed from your table definitions.

## NOCACHE option[​](#nocache-option "Direct link to NOCACHE option")

By default, QuestDB caches the symbol dictionary in memory for fast lookups.
For columns with very high cardinality (10 million+ distinct values), this
cache can consume significant memory.

Use `NOCACHE` to disable dictionary caching:

```prism-code
CREATE TABLE trades (  
    timestamp TIMESTAMP,  
    client_id SYMBOL NOCACHE,  
    symbol SYMBOL  
) TIMESTAMP(timestamp) PARTITION BY DAY;
```

**Trade-off:** `NOCACHE` reduces memory usage but makes dictionary lookups
slower. Only use it for symbols with millions of distinct values where memory
is a concern.

To toggle caching on an existing column:

```prism-code
-- Disable cache  
ALTER TABLE trades ALTER COLUMN client_id NOCACHE;  
  
-- Re-enable cache  
ALTER TABLE trades ALTER COLUMN client_id CACHE;
```

## Indexing symbols[​](#indexing-symbols "Direct link to Indexing symbols")

For columns frequently used in `WHERE` clauses, add an index:

```prism-code
CREATE TABLE trades (  
    timestamp TIMESTAMP,  
    symbol SYMBOL INDEX,  
    price DOUBLE  
) TIMESTAMP(timestamp) PARTITION BY DAY;
```

Or add an index later:

```prism-code
ALTER TABLE trades ALTER COLUMN symbol ADD INDEX;
```
