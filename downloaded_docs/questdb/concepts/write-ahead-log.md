Write-Ahead Log (WAL) records all changes before applying them to storage.
This enables concurrent writes, crash recovery, and replication.

**WAL is enabled by default and recommended for all tables.**

## Why WAL matters[​](#why-wal-matters "Direct link to Why WAL matters")

| Capability | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Concurrent writes** | Multiple clients can write simultaneously without blocking |
| **Crash recovery** | Committed data is never lost — replay from log after restart |
| **Replication** | WAL enables high availability and disaster recovery |
| **Out-of-order handling** | Late-arriving data is merged efficiently |
| **Deduplication** | Enables [DEDUP UPSERT KEYS](/docs/concepts/deduplication/) |

In QuestDB Enterprise, WAL segments are sent to object storage immediately
on commit, enabling real-time replication to standby nodes.

## Creating WAL tables[​](#creating-wal-tables "Direct link to Creating WAL tables")

WAL is enabled by default for partitioned tables:

```prism-code
CREATE TABLE prices (  
    ts TIMESTAMP,  
    ticker SYMBOL,  
    price DOUBLE  
) TIMESTAMP(ts) PARTITION BY DAY;  
-- This is a WAL table (default)
```

You can be explicit with the `WAL` keyword:

```prism-code
CREATE TABLE prices (...)  
TIMESTAMP(ts) PARTITION BY DAY WAL;
```

## Requirements[​](#requirements "Direct link to Requirements")

**WAL requires partitioning.** Non-partitioned tables cannot use WAL.

| Table creation method | Default partitioning | WAL enabled? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SQL `CREATE TABLE` without `PARTITION BY` | None | **No** |
| SQL `CREATE TABLE` with `PARTITION BY` | As specified | Yes |
| ILP auto-created tables | `PARTITION BY DAY` | Yes |

```prism-code
-- Non-partitioned = no WAL (not recommended for time-series)  
CREATE TABLE static_data (key VARCHAR, value VARCHAR);  
  
-- Partitioned = WAL enabled (recommended)  
CREATE TABLE prices (...)  
TIMESTAMP(ts) PARTITION BY DAY;
```

If you need WAL features (concurrent writes, replication, deduplication),
always specify `PARTITION BY` when creating tables via SQL.

## Checking WAL status[​](#checking-wal-status "Direct link to Checking WAL status")

Check if a table uses WAL:

```prism-code
SELECT name, walEnabled FROM tables() WHERE name = 'prices';
```

Check WAL table status:

```prism-code
SELECT * FROM wal_tables();
```

If WAL transactions are suspended (rare), resume them:

```prism-code
ALTER TABLE prices RESUME WAL;
```

## How WAL works[​](#how-wal-works "Direct link to How WAL works")

When data is written to a WAL table:

1. Data is written to WAL segments (fast sequential writes)
2. Transaction is committed and acknowledged to client
3. WAL apply job merges data into table storage asynchronously
4. In Enterprise, WAL segments replicate to object storage

This decouples the commit (fast) from storage application (background),
enabling high write throughput.

The sequencer allocates unique transaction numbers and serves as the single source of truth.

The WAL apply job collects transactions sequentially for writing to storage.

## Configuration[​](#configuration "Direct link to Configuration")

WAL behavior can be tuned via server configuration:

* `cairo.wal.enabled.default` — WAL enabled by default (default: `true`)
* Parallel threads for WAL application — see [WAL configuration](/docs/configuration/overview/#wal-table-configurations)

To convert an existing table between WAL and non-WAL:

```prism-code
ALTER TABLE prices SET TYPE WAL;  
-- Requires database restart to take effect
```

See [ALTER TABLE SET TYPE](/docs/query/sql/alter-table-set-type/) for details.
