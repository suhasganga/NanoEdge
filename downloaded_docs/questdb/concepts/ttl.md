If you're interested in storing and analyzing only recent data with QuestDB, you
can configure a time-to-live (TTL) for the table data. Both the `CREATE TABLE`
and `ALTER TABLE` commands support the `TTL` clause.

TTL provides automatic data retention by dropping old partitions without manual
intervention. For manual control over partition removal, see
[Data Retention](/docs/operations/data-retention/) which covers the
`DROP PARTITION` command.

This feature works as follows:

1. The age of the data is measured by the most recent timestamp stored in the table
2. As you keep inserting time-series data, the age of the oldest data starts
   exceeding its TTL limit
3. When **all** the data in a partition becomes stale, the partition as a whole
   becomes eligible to be dropped
4. QuestDB detects a stale partition and drops it as a part of the commit
   operation

To be more precise, the latest timestamp stored in a given partition does not
matter. Instead, QuestDB considers the entire time period for which a partition
is responsible. As a result, it will drop the partition only when the end of
that period falls behind the TTL limit. This is a compromise that favors a low
overhead of the TTL enforcement procedure.

To demonstrate, assume we have created a table partitioned by hour, with TTL set
to one hour:

```prism-code
CREATE TABLE tango (ts TIMESTAMP) timestamp (ts) PARTITION BY HOUR TTL 1 HOUR;  
-- or:  
CREATE TABLE tango (ts TIMESTAMP) timestamp (ts) PARTITION BY HOUR TTL 1H;
```

1. Insert the first row at 8:00 AM. This is the very beginning of the "8 AM"
partition:

```prism-code
INSERT INTO tango VALUES ('2025-01-01T08:00:00');
```

| ts |
| --- |
| 2025-01-01 08:00:00.000000 |

2. Insert the second row one hour later, at 9:00 AM:

```prism-code
INSERT INTO tango VALUES ('2025-01-01T09:00:00');
```

| ts |
| --- |
| 2025-01-01 08:00:00.000000 |
| 2025-01-01 09:00:00.000000 |

The 8:00 AM row remains.

3. Insert one more row at 9:59:59 AM:

```prism-code
INSERT INTO tango VALUES ('2025-01-01T09:59:59');
```

| ts |
| --- |
| 2025-01-01 08:00:00.000000 |
| 2025-01-01 09:00:00.000000 |
| 2025-01-01 09:59:59.000000 |

The 8:00 AM data is still there, because the "8 AM" partition ends at 9:00 AM.

4. Insert a row at 10:00 AM:

```prism-code
INSERT INTO tango VALUES ('2025-01-01T10:00:00');
```

| ts |
| --- |
| 2025-01-01 09:00:00.000000 |
| 2025-01-01 09:59:59.000000 |
| 2025-01-01 10:00:00.000000 |

Now the whole "8 AM" partition is outside its TTL limit, and has been dropped.

## Managing TTL[​](#managing-ttl "Direct link to Managing TTL")

### Setting TTL on existing tables[​](#setting-ttl-on-existing-tables "Direct link to Setting TTL on existing tables")

Use `ALTER TABLE SET TTL` to add or change TTL on an existing table:

```prism-code
ALTER TABLE my_table SET TTL 3 WEEKS;  
  
-- Shorthand syntax also supported  
ALTER TABLE my_table SET TTL 12h;
```

For full syntax details, see the
[ALTER TABLE SET TTL](/docs/query/sql/alter-table-set-ttl/) reference.

### Checking current TTL settings[​](#checking-current-ttl-settings "Direct link to Checking current TTL settings")

Use the `tables()` function to view TTL configuration for all tables:

```prism-code
SELECT table_name, ttlValue, ttlUnit FROM tables();
```

A `ttlValue` of `0` indicates TTL is not configured for that table.
