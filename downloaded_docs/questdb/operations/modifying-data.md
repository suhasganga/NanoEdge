QuestDB is optimized for append-only ingestion. For best performance, design
your application to avoid frequently editing existing records.

When you need to modify data, you have two options:

1. **[UPDATE statement](/docs/query/sql/update/)** - For correcting
   incorrectly inserted data. See
   [How UPDATE works](/docs/operations/updating-data/) for implementation
   details.
2. **Append-oriented alternatives** (this page) - Patterns that work with
   QuestDB's storage model instead of against it.

## Alternatives to UPDATE[​](#alternatives-to-update "Direct link to Alternatives to UPDATE")

* **[Append newest state](#append-newest-state)** - Insert a newer state to
  replace an older one. This preserves history and enables
  [bi-temporal queries](https://martinfowler.com/articles/bitemporal-history.html).
* **[Replace table](#replace-table)** - Create a new table with filtered data,
  drop the original, and rename.
* **[Drop partitions](#delete-by-dropping-partitions)** - Delete entire
  time-based partitions you no longer need.

note

Always [backup your database](/docs/operations/backup/) before modifying data.

## Append newest state[​](#append-newest-state "Direct link to Append newest state")

### Using the timestamp field[​](#using-the-timestamp-field "Direct link to Using the timestamp field")

Here's a working example using the timestamp column:

```prism-code
CREATE TABLE takeaway_order (  
    ts TIMESTAMP,  
    id SYMBOL,  
    status SYMBOL)  
        timestamp(ts);  
  
INSERT INTO takeaway_order VALUES (now(), 'order1', 'placed');  
INSERT INTO takeaway_order VALUES (now(), 'order2', 'placed');  
INSERT INTO takeaway_order VALUES (now(), 'order1', 'cooking');  
INSERT INTO takeaway_order VALUES (now(), 'order1', 'in-transit');  
INSERT INTO takeaway_order VALUES (now(), 'order1', 'arrived');  
INSERT INTO takeaway_order VALUES (now(), 'order3', 'placed');  
INSERT INTO takeaway_order VALUES (now(), 'order3', 'cooking');  
INSERT INTO takeaway_order VALUES (now(), 'order3', 'in-transit');
```

We join the latest timestamp of an order id against the rest of the data to
obtain full details.

```prism-code
WITH  
    ts_takeaway_order AS (  
        SELECT  
            max(ts) AS ts,  
            id  
        FROM  
            takeaway_order GROUP BY id)  
SELECT  
    o.*  
FROM  
    ts_takeaway_order ts_o  
    INNER JOIN 'takeaway_order' o  
    ON ts_o.ts = o.ts
```

This results in the latest state for each order:

| *timestamp* ts | id *symbol* | status *symbol* |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2022-04-07T15:33:43.944922Z | order1 | arrived |
| 2022-04-07T15:33:37.370694Z | order2 | placed |
| 2022-04-07T15:33:50.829323Z | order3 | in-transit |

### Using dedicated fields[​](#using-dedicated-fields "Direct link to Using dedicated fields")

If timestamps don't work for you here, you can also use an extra integer column
called `version`, an extra boolean `deleted` column or similar.

## Replace Table[​](#replace-table "Direct link to Replace Table")

Another alternative is to:

* Backup your database.
* Select only the data you want from an existing table into a new temporary one.
* Drop the original table.
* Rename the temporary table to the original table's name.

```prism-code
CREATE TABLE mytable_copy AS (  
    SELECT * FROM mytable WHERE column_value != 42  
) TIMESTAMP(ts) PARTITION BY DAY;  
  
DROP TABLE mytable;  
RENAME table mytable_copy TO mytable;
```

## Delete by Dropping Partitions[​](#delete-by-dropping-partitions "Direct link to Delete by Dropping Partitions")

When you create tables with a timestamp, you may organise them into
[partitions](/docs/concepts/partitions/) using the
[`CREATE TABLE .. PARTITION BY`](/docs/query/sql/create-table/#partitioning)
SQL statement. But first, [backup your database](/docs/operations/backup/).

You may then use the
[`ALTER TABLE DROP PARTITION`](/docs/query/sql/alter-table-drop-partition/)
SQL statement to drop partitions you no longer need.
