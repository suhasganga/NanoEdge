There are many variables to consider when monitoring an active production
database. This document is designed to be a helpful starting point. We plan to
expand this guide to be more helpful. If you have any recommendations, feel free
to [create an issue](https://github.com/questdb/documentation/issues) or a PR on
GitHub.

For detailed instructions on setting up Prometheus to scrape QuestDB metrics,
see the [Prometheus integration guide](/docs/integrations/other/prometheus/).

## Basic health check[​](#basic-health-check "Direct link to Basic health check")

QuestDB comes with an out-of-the-box health check HTTP endpoint:

GET health status of local instance

```prism-code
curl -v http://127.0.0.1:9003
```

Getting an OK response means the QuestDB process is up and running. This method
provides no further information.

If you allocate 8 vCPUs/cores or less to QuestDB, the HTTP server thread may not
be able to get enough CPU time to respond in a timely manner. Your load balancer
may flag the instance as dead. In such a case, create an isolated thread pool
just for the health check service (the `min` HTTP server), by setting this
configuration option:

```prism-code
http.min.worker.count=1
```

## Alert on critical errors[​](#alert-on-critical-errors "Direct link to Alert on critical errors")

QuestDB includes a log writer that sends any message logged at critical level to
Prometheus Alertmanager over a TCP/IP socket. To configure this writer, add it
to the `writers` config alongside other log writers. This is the basic setup:

log.conf

```prism-code
writers=stdout,alert  
w.alert.class=io.questdb.log.LogAlertSocketWriter  
w.alert.level=CRITICAL
```

For more details, see the
[Logging and metrics page](/docs/operations/logging-metrics/#prometheus-alertmanager).

## Detect suspended tables[​](#detect-suspended-tables "Direct link to Detect suspended tables")

QuestDB exposes a Prometheus gauge called `questdb_suspended_tables`. You can set up
to alert whenever this gauge shows an above-zero value.

## Detect slow ingestion[​](#detect-slow-ingestion "Direct link to Detect slow ingestion")

QuestDB ingests data in two stages: first it records everything to the
Write-Ahead Log. This step is optimized for throughput and usually isn't the
bottleneck. The next step is inserting the data to the table, and this can
take longer if the data is out of order, or touches different time partitions.
You can monitor the overall performance of this process of applying the WAL
data to tables. QuestDB exposes two Prometheus counters for this:

1. `questdb_wal_apply_seq_txn`: sum of all committed transaction sequence numbers
2. `questdb_wal_apply_writer_txn`: sum of all transaction sequence numbers applied to tables

Both of these numbers are continuously growing as the data is ingested. When
they are equal, all WAL data has been applied to the tables. While data is being
actively ingested, the second counter will lag behind the first one. A steady
difference between them is a sign of healthy rate of WAL application, the
database keeping up with the demand. However, if the difference continuously
rises, this indicates that either a table has become suspended and WAL can't be
applied to it, or QuestDB is not able to keep up with the ingestion rate. All of
the data is still safely stored, but a growing portion of it is not yet visible
to queries.

You can create an alert that detects a steadily increasing difference between
these two numbers. It won't tell you which table is experiencing issues, but it
is a low-impact way to detect there's a problem which needs further diagnosing.

## Monitor ingestion with SQL[​](#monitor-ingestion-with-sql "Direct link to Monitor ingestion with SQL")

For detailed per-table ingestion monitoring, use the [`tables()`](/docs/query/functions/meta/#tables)
function. Unlike Prometheus metrics which provide aggregate counters, `tables()`
returns real-time statistics for each table including WAL lag, memory pressure,
and performance histograms. The function is lightweight and fully in-memory,
suitable for frequent polling.

Key columns for ingestion monitoring:

| Column | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `wal_pending_row_count` | Rows written to WAL but not yet applied to the table |
| `table_suspended` | Whether the table is suspended (WAL apply halted) |
| `table_memory_pressure_level` | `0` (normal), `1` (reduced parallelism), `2` (backoff) |
| `wal_txn - table_txn` | Number of pending WAL transactions |
| `table_write_amp_p99` | Out-of-order merge overhead (1.0 = optimal) |
| `table_merge_rate_p99` | Slowest merge throughput in rows/second |

Example health dashboard query:

```prism-code
SELECT  
    table_name,  
    table_row_count,  
    wal_pending_row_count,  
    CASE  
        WHEN table_suspended THEN 'SUSPENDED'  
        WHEN table_memory_pressure_level = 2 THEN 'BACKOFF'  
        WHEN table_memory_pressure_level = 1 THEN 'PRESSURE'  
        ELSE 'OK'  
    END AS status,  
    wal_txn - table_txn AS lag_txns,  
    table_write_amp_p50 AS write_amp,  
    table_merge_rate_p99 AS slowest_merge  
FROM tables()  
WHERE walEnabled  
ORDER BY  
    table_suspended DESC,  
    table_memory_pressure_level DESC,  
    wal_pending_row_count DESC;
```

See the [`tables()` reference](/docs/query/functions/meta/#tables) for the
complete list of columns and additional example queries.

## Detect slow queries[​](#detect-slow-queries "Direct link to Detect slow queries")

QuestDB maintains a table called `_query_trace`, which records each executed
query and the time it took. You can query this table to find slow queries.

[Concepts page](/docs/concepts/deep-dive/query-tracing/).
