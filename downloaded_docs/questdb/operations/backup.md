You should back up QuestDB to be prepared for the case where your original
database or data is lost, or if your database or table is corrupted. The backup
& restore process is also necessary to create
[replica instances](/docs/high-availability/setup/) in QuestDB Enterprise.

## Overview[​](#overview "Direct link to Overview")

To perform a backup, follow these steps:

1. Issue SQL: `CHECKPOINT CREATE`, which activates the special `CHECKPOINT` mode
   of QuestDB
2. Create a copy of the QuestDB root directory
3. Issue SQL: `CHECKPOINT RELEASE`, bringing QuestDB back to regular operation

When in the `CHECKPOINT` mode, QuestDB remains available for both reads and
writes. However, some housekeeping tasks are paused. While this is safe in
principle, database writes may consume more space than normal. When the database
exits `CHECKPOINT` mode, it will resume the housekeeping tasks and quickly
reclaim the disk space.

In the second step above, you must create a copy of the database using a tool of
your choice. These are some suggestions:

* Cloud snapshot, e.g. EBS volume snapshot on AWS, Premium SSD Disk snapshot on
  Azure etc
* On-prem backup tools and software you typically use
* Basic command line tools, such as `cp` or `rsync`

To recover the database, follow these steps:

1. Restore the QuestDB root directory from the backup copy
2. Create an empty `_restore` trigger file in the QuestDB root directory
3. Start QuestDB as usual

If the trigger file is present in the root directory, QuestDB performs the
recovery process on startup. If successful, the process deletes the trigger
file, so it won't perform recovery in future restarts. Should recovery fail,
QuestDB will exit with an error, and the trigger file will remain in place.

## Data backup checklist[​](#data-backup-checklist "Direct link to Data backup checklist")

Before backing up QuestDB, consider these items:

### Pick a good time[​](#pick-a-good-time "Direct link to Pick a good time")

We recommend that teams take a database backup when the database write load is
at its lowest. If the database is under constant write load, a helpful
workaround is to ensure that the disk has at least 50% free space. The more free
space, the safer it is to enter the checkpoint mode.

### Determine backup frequency[​](#determine-backup-frequency "Direct link to Determine backup frequency")

We recommend daily backups.

If you are using QuestDB Enterprise, the frequency of backups impacts the time
it takes to create a new [replica instance](/docs/high-availability/setup/).
Creating replicas involves choosing a backup and having the replica replay WAL
files until it has caught up. The older the backup, the more WAL files the
replica will have to replay, and thus there is a longer time-frame. For these
reasons, we recommend a daily backup schedule to keep the process rapid.

### Choose your data copy method[​](#choose-your-data-copy-method "Direct link to Choose your data copy method")

When choosing the right copy method, consider the following goals:

* Minimize the time QuestDB spends in checkpoint mode
* Ensure that the copy time remains sustainable as the database grows

QuestDB backup lends itself relatively well to all types of differential data
copying. Due to time partitioning, older data is often unmodified, at both block
and file levels.

#### Cloud snapshots[​](#cloud-snapshots "Direct link to Cloud snapshots")

If you're using cloud disks, such as EBS on AWS, SSD on Azure, or similar, we
strongly recommend using their existing cloud *snapshot* infrastructure. The
advantages of this approach are that:

* Cloud snapshots minimizes the time QuestDB spends in checkpoint mode
* Cloud snapshots are differential and can be restored cleanly

See the following guides for volume snapshot creation on the following cloud
platforms:

* [AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-creating-snapshot.html) -
  creating EBS snapshots
* [Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/snapshot-copy-managed-disk?tabs=portal) -
  creating snapshots of a virtual hard disk
* [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/create-snapshots) - working
  with persistent disk snapshots

Cloud snapshot-based systems usually break down their backup process into two
steps:

1. Take a snapshot
2. Back up the snapshot

**Exit the `CHECKPOINT` mode as soon the snapshoting stage is complete.**

Specifically, exit checkpoint mode at the following snapshot stage:

| Cloud Provider | State | Exit checkpoint mode |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Google Cloud** (GCP) | RUNNING (UPLOADING) | When RUNNING substate changes from CREATING to UPLOADING |
| **Amazon Web Services** (AWS) | PENDING | When status is PENDING |
| **Microsoft Azure** | PENDING | Before the longer running "CREATING" stage |

#### Volume snapshots[​](#volume-snapshots "Direct link to Volume snapshots")

When the database is on-prem, we recommend using the existing file system backup
tools. Volume snapshots by, for example, can be taken via LVM:
([LVM](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/logical_volume_manager_administration/lvm_overview)).

#### File copy[​](#file-copy "Direct link to File copy")

If filesystem or volume snapshots are not available, consider using a file copy
method to back up the QuestDB server root directory. We recommend using a copy
tool that can skip copying files based on the modification date. One such
popular tool to accomplish this is [rsync](https://linux.die.net/man/1/rsync).

Leaving this step, you should know:

* Whether your method is cloud or file-system snapshot-based, or file copy-based
* When to enter and exit checkpoint mode
* How to perform your snapshot/backup method

## Steps in the backup procedure[​](#steps-in-the-backup-procedure "Direct link to Steps in the backup procedure")

While explaining the steps, we'll assume the database root directory is
`/var/lib/questdb`.

### Enter checkpoint mode[​](#enter-checkpoint-mode "Direct link to Enter checkpoint mode")

To enter the checkpoint mode:

Creating a Checkpoint

```prism-code
CHECKPOINT CREATE
```

You can create only one checkpoint. Attempting to create a second checkpoint
will fail.

### Check checkpoint status[​](#check-checkpoint-status "Direct link to Check checkpoint status")

You can double-check at any time that the database is in the checkpoint mode:

Checking Checkpoint Status

```prism-code
SELECT * FROM checkpoint_status();
```

Having confirmed that QuestDB has entered the checkpoint mode, we now create the
backup.

### Take a snapshot or begin file copy[​](#take-a-snapshot-or-begin-file-copy "Direct link to Take a snapshot or begin file copy")

After a checkpoint is created and before it is released, you may safely access
the file system using tools external to the database instance. In other words,
you're now OK to begin your backup.

If your data copy method is a volume snapshot, you can exit the checkpoint mode
as soon as the snapshot is taken (which takes a minute or two).

**Make sure to back up the entire server root directory, including the `db`,
`snapshot`, and all other directories.**

File copy may take longer to back up files compared to snapshot. You will have
to wait until the data transfer is fully complete before exiting checkpoint
mode.

**It is very important to exit the checkpoint mode regardless of whether the
copy operation succeeded or failed!**

### Exit checkpoint mode[​](#exit-checkpoint-mode "Direct link to Exit checkpoint mode")

With your backup complete, exit checkpoint mode:

Releasing a Checkpoint

```prism-code
CHECKPOINT RELEASE
```

This concludes the backup process.

Now, with our additional copy, we're ready to restore QuestDB.

## Restore to a saved checkpoint[​](#restore-to-a-saved-checkpoint "Direct link to Restore to a saved checkpoint")

Restoring to a checkpoint will restore the entire database.

Follow these steps:

* Ensure your QuestDB version matches the one that did the backup
* Restore QuestDB root directory contents (`/var/lib/questdb/`) from the backup
* Touch the `_restore` file
* Start the database using the restored root directory

### Database versions[​](#database-versions "Direct link to Database versions")

Restoring data is only possible if the backup and restore QuestDB versions have
the same major version number, for example: `8.1.0` and `8.1.1` are compatible.
`8.1.0` and `7.5.1` are not compatible.

### Restore the root directory[​](#restore-the-root-directory "Direct link to Restore the root directory")

When using cloud tools, create a new disk from the snapshot. The entire disk
contents of the original database will be available when the compute instance
starts.

If you are not using cloud tools, you have to make sure that you restore the
root from the backup using your own tools of choice!

### The trigger file[​](#the-trigger-file "Direct link to The trigger file")

When you are starting the database from the backup for the first time, the
database must perform a restore procedure. This ensures the data is consistent
and can be read and written. It only takes place on startup, and requires a
specific blank file to exist as the indication of user intent.

Touch the `_restore` file in the root directory. The following command will do
the trick:

```prism-code
touch /var/lib/questdb/_restore
```

### Start the database[​](#start-the-database "Direct link to Start the database")

Start the database using the root directory as usual. When the `_restore` file
is present, the database will perform the restore procedure. There are two
possible outcomes:

* Restore is successful: the database continues to run normally and is ready to
  use; the `_restore` file is removed to prevent the same procedure running
  twice
* Restore fails: the database exits and the `_restore` file remains in place. An
  error message appears in `stderr`. If it can be resolved, starting the
  database again will retry the restore procedure

## Supported filesystems[​](#supported-filesystems "Direct link to Supported filesystems")

QuestDB supports the following filesystems:

* APFS
* EXT4
* NTFS
* OVERLAYFS (used by Docker)
* XFS
* ZFS

Other file systems are untested and while they may work, we do not officially
support them. See the
[filesystem compatibility](/docs/getting-started/capacity-planning/#supported-filesystems)
section for more information.
