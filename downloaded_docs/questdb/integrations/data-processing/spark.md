High-level instructions for loading data from QuestDB to Spark and back.

## What is Spark?[​](#what-is-spark "Direct link to What is Spark?")

[Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) is an analytics engine for large-scale
data engineering and [stream processing](https://questdb.com/glossary/stream-processing),
well-known in the big data landscape. It is suitable for executing data
engineering, data science, and machine learning on single-node machines or
clusters.

## QuestDB Spark integration[​](#questdb-spark-integration "Direct link to QuestDB Spark integration")

A typical Spark application processes data in the following steps:

1. Loading data from different sources
2. Transforming and analyzing the data
3. Saving the result to a data storage

Our example demonstrates these steps using QuestDB as the data source and
storage. It loads data from QuestDB into a Spark Dataframe; then the data is
enriched with new features, and eventually, it is written back into QuestDB.

## Prerequisites[​](#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")

* **Package manager**: This depends on your choice of OS. The below instructions
  are for macOS using Homebrew.
* **QuestDB**: An instance must be running and accessible. Not running? Checkout
  the [quick start](/docs/getting-started/quick-start/).

## Installing Apache Spark[​](#installing-apache-spark "Direct link to Installing Apache Spark")

Spark can be installed and set up in many ways, depending on requirements.
Typically, it is part of a Big Data stack, installed on multiple nodes with an
external cluster manager, such as
[Yarn](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/YARN.html)
or [Apache Mesos](https://mesos.apache.org/). In this tutorial, we will work
with a single-node standalone Spark installation.

Spark has a multi-language environment. It is written in Scala, runs on the Java
Virtual Machine, and also integrates with R and Python. Our example is written
using Python. By running the below commands Spark will be installed with all
required dependencies:

```prism-code
brew install openjdk@11  
brew install python@3.10  
brew install scala  
brew install apache-spark
```

The exact versions used for this example:

```prism-code
openjdk@11 11.0.12  
python@3.10 3.10.10_1  
scala 3.2.2  
apache-spark 3.3.2
```

## Installing the JDBC driver[​](#installing-the-jdbc-driver "Direct link to Installing the JDBC driver")

Spark communicates with QuestDB via JDBC, connecting to its Postgres Wire
Protocol endpoint. This requires the Postgres JDBC driver to be present.

* Create a working directory:

```prism-code
mkdir sparktest  
cd sparktest
```

* Download the JDBC driver from [here](https://jdbc.postgresql.org/download/)
  into the working directory. The exact version used for this example:

```prism-code
postgresql-42.5.1.jar
```

## Setting up database tables[​](#setting-up-database-tables "Direct link to Setting up database tables")

First, start QuestDB. If you are using Docker run the following command:

```prism-code
docker run -p 9000:9000 -p 8812:8812 questdb/questdb:9.3.1
```

The port mappings allow us to connect to QuestDB's REST and PostgreSQL Wire
Protocol endpoints. The former is required for opening the Web Console, and the
latter is used by Spark to connect to the database.

Open the [Web Console](/docs/getting-started/web-console/overview/) in your browser at
`http://localhost:9000`.

Run the following SQL commands using the console:

```prism-code
CREATE TABLE trades (  
  symbol SYMBOL,  
  side SYMBOL,  
  price DOUBLE,  
  amount DOUBLE,  
  timestamp TIMESTAMP  
) timestamp (timestamp) PARTITION BY DAY;  
  
CREATE TABLE trades_enriched (  
  symbol SYMBOL,  
  volume DOUBLE,  
  mid DOUBLE,  
  ts TIMESTAMP,  
  ma10 DOUBLE,  
  std DOUBLE  
) timestamp (ts) PARTITION BY DAY;  
  
INSERT INTO trades SELECT * FROM (  
  SELECT 'BTC-USD' symbol,  
  rnd_symbol('buy', 'sell') side,  
  rnd_double() * 10000 price,  
  rnd_double() amount,  
  timestamp_sequence(1677628800000000, 10000000) ts  
  FROM long_sequence(25920)  
) timestamp (ts);
```

The `INSERT` command generates 3 days' worth of test data, and stores it in the
`trades` table.

## Feature engineering examples[​](#feature-engineering-examples "Direct link to Feature engineering examples")

Save the below Python code into a file called `sparktest.py` inside the working
directory:

```prism-code
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession  
from pyspark.sql.window import Window  
from pyspark.sql.functions import avg, stddev, when  
  
# create Spark session  
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("questdb_test").getOrCreate()  
  
# load 1-minute aggregated trade data into the dataframe  
df = spark.read.format("jdbc") \  
    .option("url", "jdbc:postgresql://localhost:8812/questdb") \  
    .option("driver", "org.postgresql.Driver") \  
    .option("user", "admin").option("password", "quest") \  
    .option("dbtable", "(SELECT symbol, sum(amount) as volume, "  
                       "round((max(price)+min(price))/2, 2) as mid, "  
                       "timestamp as ts "  
                       "FROM trades WHERE symbol = 'BTC-USD' "  
                       "SAMPLE BY 1m ALIGN to CALENDAR) AS mid_prices") \  
    .option("partitionColumn", "ts") \  
    .option("numPartitions", "3") \  
    .option("lowerBound", "2023-03-01T00:00:00.000000Z") \  
    .option("upperBound", "2023-03-04T00:00:00.000000Z") \  
    .load()  
  
# extract new features, clean data  
window_10 = Window.partitionBy(df.symbol).rowsBetween(-10, Window.currentRow)  
df = df.withColumn("ma10", avg(df.mid).over(window_10))  
df = df.withColumn("std", stddev(df.mid).over(window_10))  
df = df.withColumn("std", when(df.std.isNull(), 0.0).otherwise(df.std))  
  
# save the data as 'trades_enriched', overwrite if already exists  
df.write.format("jdbc") \  
    .option("url", "jdbc:postgresql://localhost:8812/questdb") \  
    .option("driver", "org.postgresql.Driver") \  
    .option("user", "admin").option("password", "quest") \  
    .option("dbtable", "trades_enriched") \  
    .option("truncate", True) \  
    .option("createTableColumnTypes", "volume DOUBLE, mid DOUBLE, ma10 DOUBLE, std DOUBLE") \  
    .save(mode="overwrite")
```

This Spark application loads aggregated data from the `trades` table into a
Dataframe, then adds two new features, a 10-minute moving average and the
standard deviation. Finally, it writes the enriched data back into QuestDB and
saves it to the `trades_enriched` table.

## Run the example[​](#run-the-example "Direct link to Run the example")

Submit the application to Spark for execution using `spark-submit`:

```prism-code
spark-submit --jars postgresql-42.5.1.jar sparktest.py
```

The example requires the JDBC driver at runtime. This dependency is submitted to
Spark using the `--jars` option.

After the execution is completed, we can check the content of the
`trades_enriched` table:

```prism-code
SELECT * FROM trades_enriched;
```

The enriched data should be displayed in the [Web Console](/docs/getting-started/web-console/overview/).
