[Grafana](https://grafana.com/) is a popular observability and monitoring
application used to visualize data and enable [time-series data analysis](https://questdb.com/glossary/time-series-analysis/).

QuestDB is available within Grafana via the
[official QuestDB plugin](https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/questdb-questdb-datasource/).

warning

QuestDB can also be used with the PostgreSQL Grafana plugin, but the configuration options are different in that case. The QuestDB official plugin is strongly recommended instead.

For a walk-through style guide, see our
[blog post](https://questdb.com/blog/time-series-monitoring-dashboard-grafana-questdb/).

## Prerequisites[​](#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")

* [Docker](/docs/deployment/docker/) to run both Grafana and QuestDB
  + We will use the `--add-host` parameter for both Grafana and QuestDB.

## Start Grafana[​](#start-grafana "Direct link to Start Grafana")

Start Grafana using `docker run`:

```prism-code
docker run --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway \  
-p 3000:3000 --name=grafana \  
-v grafana-storage:/var/lib/grafana \  
grafana/grafana-oss
```

Once the Grafana server has started, you can access it via port 3000
(`http://localhost:3000`). The default login credentials
are as follows:

```prism-code
user:admin  
password:admin
```

## Start QuestDB[​](#start-questdb "Direct link to Start QuestDB")

The Docker version runs on port `8812` for the database connection and port
`9000` for the [Web Console](/docs/getting-started/web-console/overview/) and REST interface:

```prism-code
docker run --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway \  
-p 9000:9000 -p 9009:9009 -p 8812:8812 -p 9003:9003 \  
-v "$(pwd):/var/lib/questdb" \  
-e QDB_PG_READONLY_USER_ENABLED=true \  
questdb/questdb:latest
```

## Add a data source[​](#add-a-data-source "Direct link to Add a data source")

1. Open Grafana's UI (by default available at
   `http://localhost:3000`)
2. Navigate to the bottom of the page and click **Find more data source
   plugins**.
3. Search for QuestDB and click **Install**.
4. Once the QuestDB data source for Grafana is finished installing, click on the
   blue **Add new data source** button where the **Install** button used to be.
5. Enter the connection settings.
   1. Notice that `Server Address` is the host address without the port. Some common values are `host.docker.internal` when using Docker on the same host, `localhost` when running standalone Grafana on the same host, or the QuestDB instance IP address when running Grafana remotely.
   2. The port, which defaults to `8812` is passed as a separate parameter.
   3. For QuestDB Open Source, TLS/SSL mode should be `disable`. This can be left empty for QuestDB Enterprise.

```prism-code
Server address: host.docker.internal  
Server port: 8812  
Username: user  
Password: quest  
TLS/SSL mode: disable
```

6. Toggle the **Query Builder** to **SQL Editor** by clicking the button.
7. Write SQL queries!

## Real-time refresh rates[​](#real-time-refresh-rates "Direct link to Real-time refresh rates")

By default, Grafana limits the maximum refresh rate of your dashboards. The
maximum default rate is to refresh every 5 seconds. This is to provide relief to
the database under-the-hood. However, with QuestBD's significant performance
optimizations, we can lower this rate for greater fluidity.

To learn how, see our
[blog post](https://questdb.com/blog/increase-grafana-refresh-rate-frequency/).

## Global variables[​](#global-variables "Direct link to Global variables")

Use
[global variables](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/variables/variable-types/global-variables/#global-variables)
to simplify queries with dynamic elements such as date range filters.

### `$__timeFilter(timestamp)`[​](#__timefiltertimestamp "Direct link to __timefiltertimestamp")

This variable allows filtering results by sending a start-time and end-time to
QuestDB. This expression evaluates to:

```prism-code
timestamp BETWEEN  
    '2018-02-01T00:00:00Z' AND '2018-02-28T23:59:59Z'
```

### `$__interval`[​](#__interval "Direct link to __interval")

This variable calculates a dynamic interval based on the time range applied to
the dashboard. By using this function, the sampling interval changes
automatically as the user zooms in and out of the panel.

An example of $\_\_interval

```prism-code
SELECT  
  timestamp AS time,  
  avg(price) AS avg_price  
FROM trades  
WHERE $__timeFilter(timestamp)  
SAMPLE BY $__interval;
```
