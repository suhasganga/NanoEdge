Embeddable is a developer toolkit for building fast, interactive customer-facing
analytics. It works well with a high performance time-series database like
QuestDB.

In [Embeddable](https://embeddable.com/) you define
[Data Models](https://docs.embeddable.com/data-modeling/introduction)
and
[Components](https://docs.embeddable.com/development/introduction)
in code, which are stored in your own code repository, then use the **SDK** to make these
available for your team in the powerful Embeddable **no-code builder.** The end
result is the ability to deliver fast, interactive **customer-facing analytics**
directly into your product.

Built-in **row-level security** means that every user only ever sees **exactly**
the data they’re allowed to see. And two levels of fully-configurable
**caching** mean you can deliver fast, realtime analytics at scale.

## Prerequisites[​](#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")

* A running QuestDB instance
  + Not running yet? See the [quick start](/docs/getting-started/quick-start/)

## Getting started with Embeddable[​](#getting-started-with-embeddable "Direct link to Getting started with Embeddable")

Add a database connection using Embeddable API. This connection connects to your
QuestDB instance. To add a connection, use the following API call:

```prism-code
// for security reasons, this must *never* be called from your client-side  
fetch("https://api.embeddable.com/api/v1/connections", {  
  method: "POST",  
  headers: {  
    "Content-Type": "application/json",  
    Accept: "application/json",  
    Authorization: `Bearer ${apiKey}` /* keep your API Key secure */,  
  },  
  body: JSON.stringify({  
    name: "my-questdb-db",  
    type: "questdb",  
    credentials: {  
      host: "my.questdb.host",  
      port: "8812",  
      user: "admin",  
      password: "quest",  
    },  
  }),  
})
```

In response you will receive:

```prism-code
Status 201 { errorMessage: null }
```

The above represents a `CREATE` action, but all `CRUD` operations are available.

The `apiKey` can be found by clicking “**Publish**” on one of your Embeddable
dashboards.

The `name` is a unique name to identify this connection.

* By default your data models will look for a connection called “default”, but you can supply your models with different `data_source` names to support connecting different data models to different connections (simply specify the data\_source name in the model)

The `type` tells Embeddable which driver to use

* Here you'll want to use `questbd`, but you can connect multiple different datasources to one Embeddable workspace so you may use others such as: `postgres`, `bigquery`, `mongodb`, etc.

The `credentials` is a javascript object containing the necessary credentials expected by the driver

* These are securely encrypted and only used to retrieve exactly the data you have described in your data models.
* Embeddable strongly encourage you to create a read-only database user for each connection (Embeddable will only ever read from your database, not write).

In order to support connecting to different databases for prod, qa, test, etc (or to support different databases for different customers) you can assign each connection to an environment (see [Environments API](https://docs.embeddable.com/data/environments)).
