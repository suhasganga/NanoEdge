Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit. Prometheus
collects and stores metrics as
[time-series data](https://questdb.com/blog/what-is-time-series-data/), i.e. metrics information is
stored with the timestamp at which it was recorded, alongside optional key-value
pairs called labels.

Users can measure the internal status of a QuestDB instance via an HTTP endpoint
exposed by QuestDB at port `9003`. This document describes how to enable metrics
via this endpoint, how to configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from a QuestDB
instance, and how to enable alerting from QuestDB to Prometheus Alertmanager.

For guidance on what metrics to monitor and alerting strategies, see
[Monitoring and alerting](/docs/operations/monitoring-alerting/).

## Prerequisites[​](#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")

* **QuestDB** must be running and accessible. Checkout the
  [quick start](/docs/getting-started/quick-start/).
* **Prometheus** can be installed using
  [homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/prometheus),
  [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/u/prom), or directly as a binary. For more
  details, refer to the official Prometheus
  [installation instructions](https://prometheus.io/download/).
* **Alertmanager** can be run using
  [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/prom/alertmanager/) or
  [Quay](https://quay.io/repository/prometheus/alertmanager), or can be built
  from source by following the
  [build instructions on GitHub](https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager#compiling-the-binary).

## Scraping Prometheus metrics from QuestDB[​](#scraping-prometheus-metrics-from-questdb "Direct link to Scraping Prometheus metrics from QuestDB")

QuestDB has a `/metrics` HTTP endpoint on port `9003` to expose Prometheus
metrics. Before being able to query metrics, they must be enabled via the
`metrics.enabled` key in server configuration:

/path/to/server.conf

```prism-code
metrics.enabled=true
```

When running QuestDB via Docker, port `9003` must be exposed and the metrics
configuration can be enabled via the `QDB_METRICS_ENABLED` environment variable:

Docker

```prism-code
docker run \  
-e QDB_METRICS_ENABLED=TRUE \  
-p 8812:8812 -p 9000:9000 -p 9003:9003 -p 9009:9009 \  
-v "$(pwd):/var/lib/questdb" \  
questdb/questdb:9.3.1
```

To verify that metrics are being exposed correctly by QuestDB, navigate to
`http://<questdb_ip>:9003/metrics` in a browser, where `<questdb_ip>` is the IP
address of an instance, or execute a basic curl like the following example:

Given QuestDB running at 127.0.0.1

```prism-code
curl http://127.0.0.1:9003/metrics  
# TYPE questdb_json_queries_total counter  
questdb_json_queries_total 0  
  
# TYPE questdb_memory_tag_MMAP_DEFAULT gauge  
questdb_memory_tag_MMAP_DEFAULT 77872  
  
# TYPE questdb_memory_malloc_count gauge  
questdb_memory_malloc_count 659  
  
# ...
```

To configure Prometheus to scrape these metrics, provide the QuestDB instance IP
and port `9003` as a target. The following example configuration file
`questdb.yml` assumes there is a running QuestDB instance on localhost
(127.0.0.1) with port `9003` available:

questdb.yml

```prism-code
global:  
  scrape_interval: 5s  
  external_labels:  
    monitor: 'questdb'  
  
scrape_configs:  
  - job_name: 'questdb'  
    scrape_interval: 5s  
    static_configs:  
      - targets: ['127.0.0.1:9003']
```

Start Prometheus and pass this configuration on launch:

```prism-code
prometheus --config.file=questdb.yml
```

Prometheus should be available on `0.0.0.0:9090` and navigating to
`http://0.0.0.0:9090/targets` should show that QuestDB is being scraped
successfully:

![Prometheus targets tab showing a QuestDB instance status](/docs/images/guides/prometheus/healthy-targets.webp)

In the graphing tab of Prometheus (`http://0.0.0.0:9090/graph`), autocomplete
can be used to graph QuestDB-specific metrics which are all prefixed with
`questdb_`:

database start. The exception are `questdb_wal_seq_txn` and
`questdb_wal_writer_txn`, because transaction sequence numbers are persistent.

## Configuring Prometheus Alertmanager[​](#configuring-prometheus-alertmanager "Direct link to Configuring Prometheus Alertmanager")

note

Full details on logging configurations can be found within the
[Logging & Metrics documentation](/docs/operations/logging-metrics/).

QuestDB includes a log writer that sends any message logged at critical level
(by default) to Prometheus
[Alertmanager](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/alertmanager/) over a
TCP/IP socket connection. To configure this writer, add it to the `writers`
config alongside other log writers.

Alertmanager may be started via Docker with the following command:

```prism-code
docker run -p 127.0.0.1:9093:9093 --name alertmanager quay.io/prometheus/alertmanager
```

To discover the IP address of this container, run the following command which
specifies `alertmanager` as the container name:

```prism-code
docker inspect -f '{{range.NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' alertmanager
```

To run QuestDB and point it towards Alertmanager for alerting, first create a
file `./conf/log.conf` with the following contents. `172.17.0.2` in this case is
the IP address of the docker container for alertmanager that was discovered by
running the `docker inspect` command above.

./conf/log.conf

```prism-code
# Which writers to enable  
writers=stdout,alert  
  
# stdout  
w.stdout.class=io.questdb.log.LogConsoleWriter  
w.stdout.level=INFO  
  
# Prometheus Alerting  
w.alert.class=io.questdb.log.LogAlertSocketWriter  
w.alert.level=CRITICAL  
w.alert.alertTargets=172.17.0.2:9093
```

Start up QuestDB in Docker using the following command:

```prism-code
docker run \  
  -p 9000:9000 -p 8812:8812 -p 9009:9009 -p 9003:9003 \  
  -v "$(pwd)::/var/lib/questdb" \  
  questdb/questdb:6.1.3
```

When alerts are successfully triggered, QuestDB logs will indicate the sent and
received status:

```prism-code
2021-12-14T18:42:54.222967Z I i.q.l.LogAlertSocketWriter Sending: 2021-12-14T18:42:54.122874Z I i.q.l.LogAlertSocketWriter Sending: 2021-12-14T18:42:54.073978Z I i.q.l.LogAlertSocketWriter Received [0] 172.17.0.2:9093: {"status":"success"}  
2021-12-14T18:42:54.223377Z I i.q.l.LogAlertSocketWriter Received [0] 172.17.0.2:9093: {"status":"success"}
```
