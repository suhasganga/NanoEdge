[Inductive Automation Ignition](https://inductiveautomation.com/ignition/) is a software suite for industrial automation,
deployed by hundreds of companies worldwide. The platform includes a variety of tools, including a SCADA system, IIoT integrations,
and monitoring and reporting capabilities.

The release of [Ignition 8.3](https://inductiveautomation.com/ignition/whatsnew) integrates QuestDB in the new [Core Historian](https://inductiveautomation.com/ignition/modules/historian) module,
replacing the legacy `SQLite` based historian. This module raises the performance ceiling, making the `Core Historian` a viable turnkey
solution for industrial time-series data, without the need to invest in (and configure) an external traditional RBDMS.

## Prerequisites[​](#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")

* [Ignition 8.3](https://inductiveautomation.com/ignition/whatsnew)
* [Core Historian module](https://inductiveautomation.com/ignition/modules/historian)

## Getting started[​](#getting-started "Direct link to Getting started")

For initial configuration of the Core Historian, please follow the Inductive University introductory video.

[![Core Historian Introduction](/docs/images/guides/ignition/core-historian-tutorial.png)](https://inductiveuniversity.com/videos/core-historian/8.3)

QuestDB is fully-integrated behind the scenes, and all tag historian actions can be performed via the UI.

## UI properties[​](#ui-properties "Direct link to UI properties")

Additional configuration settings can be found in the [Core Historian documentation](https://docs.inductiveautomation.com/docs/8.3/ignition-modules/tag-historian/tag-history-providers/internal-historian-questdb).

Some of the properties correspond to specific QuestDB features:

* `Partition Interval`
  + This corresponds to the `PARTITION BY` clause of a [`CREATE TABLE`](/docs/query/sql/create-table/) statement.
  + Data will be vertically partitioned according to the provided unit.
  + See [partition concepts](/docs/concepts/partitions/) for more information.
* `Data Deduplication`
  + This corresponds to the `DEDUP` clause of a [`CREATE TABLE`](/docs/query/sql/create-table/#deduplication) statement.
  + New rows which match the deduplication keys will be replaced instead of inserted as new rows.
  + See [dedup concepts](/docs/concepts/deduplication/) for more information.

## Gateway configuration[​](#gateway-configuration "Direct link to Gateway configuration")

Additional settings can be configured in the gateway to control the backing QuestDB instance's behaviour. These are specified
in the [Gateway and Gateway and Gateway Network Parameters](https://www.docs.inductiveautomation.com/docs/8.3/appendix/reference-pages/gateway-configuration-file-reference/gateway-and-gateway-network-parameters#core-historian)
documentation.

### Direct queries[​](#direct-queries "Direct link to Direct queries")

Ignition can be configured to expose QuestDB's Postgres wire server, allowing for read queries to be run directly against the underlying database.

* `historian.questdb.pgwireServerEnabled`
  + Corresponds to `pg.enabled` in QuestDB's `server.conf`
  + Enables the PG Wire server on the default port (8812).
* `historian.questdb.pgwireServerPort`
  + Corresponds to the port half of `pg.net.bind.to` in QuestDB's `server.conf`.
  + Changes the server port from the default (8812) to the specified integer.

### Resource usage[​](#resource-usage "Direct link to Resource usage")

Ignition also exposes settings to control the amount of memory allocated to the underlying database.

* `historian.questdb.ramUsageLimitBytes`
  + Corresponds to `ram.usage.limit.bytes` in QuestDB's `server.conf`.
  + Controls the amount of RAM allocated to the database in bytes.
* `historian.questdb.ramUsageLimitPercent`
  + Corresponds to `ram.usage.limit.percent` in QuestDB's `server.conf`.
  + Control the amount of RAM allocated to the database as a percentage of system memory.
