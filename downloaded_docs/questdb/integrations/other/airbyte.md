## Example inputs[​](#example-inputs "Direct link to Example inputs")

In this section, we will demonstrate how to set up Airbyte to extract data from a PostgreSQL source and send it to QuestDB.

### PostgreSQL source configuration[​](#postgresql-source-configuration "Direct link to PostgreSQL source configuration")

1. **Setting Up the Source**:
   To set up the source connector, you will need the following configuration details:

```prism-code
{  
  "sourceType": "postgresql",  
  "configuration": {  
    "host": "your_postgres_host",  
    "port": 5432,  
    "database": "your_database",  
    "username": "your_username",  
    "password": "your_password",  
    "ssl": false,  
    "table_name": "your_table"  
  }  
}
```

2. **Sample Data Extraction**:
   You can run a sample query to test the connection and see the kind of data that will be extracted:

```prism-code
SELECT * FROM your_table LIMIT 10;
```

### Writing to QuestDB[​](#writing-to-questdb "Direct link to Writing to QuestDB")

After configuring your PostgreSQL source, the next step is to configure the destination to send the extracted data to QuestDB.

#### QuestDB destination configuration[​](#questdb-destination-configuration "Direct link to QuestDB destination configuration")

1. **Setting Up the Destination**:
   Here's how to configure the destination connector for QuestDB:

```prism-code
{  
  "destinationType": "questdb",  
  "configuration": {  
    "host": "localhost",  
    "port": 8812,  
    "database": "your_database",  
    "username": "admin",  
    "password": "",  
    "table": "your_table",  
    "batch_size": 1000  
  }  
}
```

2. **Data Format**:
   QuestDB expects the data in a specific format. Here's an example of how the data might look when being sent:

```prism-code
[  
  {  
    "column1": "value1",  
    "column2": 123,  
    "column3": "2023-10-19T12:00:00Z"  
  },  
  {  
    "column1": "value2",  
    "column2": 456,  
    "column3": "2023-10-19T12:05:00Z"  
  }  
]
```

### Running the connection[​](#running-the-connection "Direct link to Running the connection")

Once you have both the source and destination configured, you can create a connection between them.

1. **Creating the Connection**:
   In the Airbyte dashboard, navigate to the **Connections** tab, and create a new connection with the following details:

```prism-code
{  
  "sourceId": "your_postgres_source_id",  
  "destinationId": "your_questdb_destination_id",  
  "syncMode": "full_refresh",  
  "schedule": {  
    "units": 1,  
    "timeUnit": "hours"  
  }  
}
```

### Monitoring sync status[​](#monitoring-sync-status "Direct link to Monitoring sync status")

Once the sync process is initiated, you can monitor its status directly in the Airbyte dashboard.

#### Example sync status output[​](#example-sync-status-output "Direct link to Example sync status output")

```prism-code
{  
  "status": "COMPLETED",  
  "records_transferred": 150,  
  "start_time": "2023-10-19T12:00:00Z",  
  "end_time": "2023-10-19T12:10:00Z",  
  "errors": []  
}
```

### Debugging tips[​](#debugging-tips "Direct link to Debugging tips")

If you encounter issues during the sync process, consider the following debugging steps:

* **Check Connection Settings**: Ensure the host, port, and authentication details are correct in both the source and destination configurations.
* **Review Logs**: Check the Airbyte logs for any error messages. Logs can provide insight into connection failures or data format issues.
* **Test Queries**: Use the query tools available in your PostgreSQL and QuestDB interfaces to test individual queries and see what data is being extracted or sent.

## Verifying the integration[​](#verifying-the-integration "Direct link to Verifying the integration")

1. **Access the QuestDB Web Console**:
   Navigate to the [QuestDB Web Console](/docs/getting-started/web-console/overview/) at `http://127.0.0.1:9000/`. Once you're on the console, check the Schema Navigator in the top left. You should see two new tables:

   * `cpu` (generated from `inputs.cpu`)
   * `mem` (generated from `inputs.mem`)
2. **Run a Query on the `cpu` Table**:
   To verify that data is being correctly written to the `cpu` table, type the following query in the editor and click **RUN**:

```prism-code
SELECT * FROM cpu;
```

3. **Inspect the Results**:
   After running the query, the results should display columns for each metric collected by the [Telegraf](/docs/ingestion/message-brokers/telegraf/) plugin for monitoring CPU usage, such as:

   * `usage_idle`
   * `usage_user`
   * `usage_system`
   * `usage_iowait`

   Here's an example of what the results may look like:

```prism-code
| timestamp            | usage_idle | usage_user | usage_system | usage_iowait |  
|----------------------|------------|------------|--------------|--------------|  
| 2024-10-19T12:00:00Z | 60         | 30         | 10           | 0            |  
| 2024-10-19T12:05:00Z | 58         | 31         | 9            | 2            |
```

4. **Run a Query on the `mem` Table**:
   Similarly, you can check the `mem` table by running the following query:

```prism-code
SELECT * FROM mem;
```

This will display memory usage statistics collected by Telegraf, which might include:

* `total`
* `available`
* `used`
* `free`

5. **Sample Memory Query Results**:

```prism-code
| timestamp            | total      | available | used        | free        |  
|----------------------|------------|-----------|-------------|-------------|  
| 2024-10-19T12:00:00Z | 8000       | 3000      | 4000        | 1000        |  
| 2024-10-19T12:05:00Z | 8000       | 2900      | 4100        | 1000        |
```

## Best practices[​](#best-practices "Direct link to Best practices")

To ensure a smooth and efficient integration between Airbyte and QuestDB, consider the following best practices:

1. **Optimize Data Load Frequency**
   * Use batch processing to reduce load on QuestDB.
   * Implement incremental sync where possible to only load new or changed data.

```prism-code
# Example Airbyte configuration for incremental sync  
sync_mode: incremental
```

2. **Data Types and Schema Alignment**
   * Ensure data types in Airbyte's source match the destination schema in QuestDB.
   * Pre-define tables in QuestDB before starting the sync.

```prism-code
-- Example SQL for creating a table in QuestDB  
CREATE TABLE my_table (  
    id INT,  
    name STRING,  
    created_at TIMESTAMP  
) timestamp(created_at);
```

3. **Use Connection Retry Logic**
   * Configure Airbyte to retry connections in case of temporary failures.

```prism-code
# Example Airbyte connection configuration with retries  
retries: 3
```

4. **Monitor Resource Utilization**

   * Keep an eye on CPU and memory usage on both Airbyte and QuestDB.
   * Enable logging in Airbyte to track data sync processes.
5. **Query Optimization**

   * Use indexing in QuestDB to speed up queries on frequently accessed columns.

```prism-code
-- Example SQL for creating an index  
CREATE INDEX ON my_table (name);
```

6. **Data Validation**
   * Implement post-load checks to verify data integrity.

```prism-code
-- Example SQL for counting records after load  
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM my_table;
```

## Troubleshooting[​](#troubleshooting "Direct link to Troubleshooting")

If you do not see the expected tables or data in QuestDB:

* **Check Airbyte Logs**: Ensure there are no errors in the Airbyte dashboard regarding the sync process.
* **Verify Configuration**: Revisit both the source and destination configurations to ensure they match the expected settings.
* **Consult QuestDB Logs**: Check the QuestDB logs for any error messages indicating issues with data ingestion.
