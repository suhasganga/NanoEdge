QuestDB has images for both Linux/macOS and Windows on
[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/questdb/questdb).

## Install Docker[​](#install-docker "Direct link to Install Docker")

To begin, install Docker. You can find guides for your platform on the
[official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

## Run QuestDB image[​](#run-questdb-image "Direct link to Run QuestDB image")

Once Docker is installed, you will need to pull QuestDB's image from
[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/questdb/questdb) and create a container.

This can be done with a single command using:

```prism-code
docker run \  
-p 9000:9000 -p 9009:9009 -p 8812:8812 -p 9003:9003 \  
questdb/questdb:9.3.1
```

This command starts a Docker container from `questdb/questdb` image. In
addition, it exposes some ports, allowing you to explore QuestDB.

In order to configure QuestDB, it is recommended to mount a
[volume](#-v-parameter-to-mount-storage) to allow data persistance. This can be
done by adding a `-v` flag to the above command:

```prism-code
-v "/host/volume/location:/var/lib/questdb"
```

Below each parameter is described in detail.

### `-p` parameter to expose ports[​](#-p-parameter-to-expose-ports "Direct link to -p-parameter-to-expose-ports")

This parameter will expose a port to the host. You can specify:

* `-p 9000:9000` - [REST API](/docs/query/rest-api/) and
  [Web Console](/docs/getting-started/web-console/overview/)
* `-p 9009:9009` - [InfluxDB line protocol](/docs/ingestion/ilp/overview/)
* `-p 8812:8812` - [Postgres wire protocol](/docs/query/pgwire/overview/)
* `-p 9003:9003` -
  [Min health server](/docs/operations/logging-metrics/#minimal-http-server)

All ports are optional, you can pick only the ones you need. For example, it is
enough to expose `8812` if you only plan to use
[Postgres wire protocol](/docs/query/pgwire/overview/).

### `-v` parameter to mount storage[​](#-v-parameter-to-mount-storage "Direct link to -v-parameter-to-mount-storage")

This parameter will make a local directory available to QuestDB Docker
container. It will have all data ingested to QuestDB, server logs and
configuration.

The QuestDB [root\_directory](/docs/concepts/deep-dive/root-directory-structure/) is located
at the `/var/lib/questdb` path in the container.

### Docker image version[​](#docker-image-version "Direct link to Docker image version")

By default, `questdb/questdb` points to the latest QuestDB version available on
Docker. However, it is recommended to define the version used.

```prism-code
questdb/questdb:9.3.1
```

## Environment variables[​](#environment-variables "Direct link to Environment variables")

Server configuration can be passed to QuestDB running in Docker by using the
`-e` flag to pass an environment variable to a container:

```prism-code
docker run -p 4000:4000 -e QDB_HTTP_BIND_TO=0.0.0.0:4000 questdb/questdb
```

For a list of configuration options, see [Configuration](/docs/configuration/overview/).

## Container status[​](#container-status "Direct link to Container status")

You can check the status of your container with `docker ps`.

It also lists the exposed ports, container name, uptime and more:

Finding container status with docker ps

```prism-code
docker ps
```

Result of docker ps

```prism-code
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                NAMES  
dd363939f261        questdb/questdb     "/app/bin/java -m io…"   3 seconds ago       Up 2 seconds        8812/tcp, 9000/tcp   frosty_gauss
```

This container:

* has an id of `dd363939f261`
* uses ports `8812` & `9000`, for Postgres wire protocol and HTTP respectively
* is using a `questdb/questdb` image
* ran java to start the binary
* is 3 seconds old
* has been up for 2 seconds
* has the unfortunate name of `frosty_gauss`

For full container status information, see the
[`docker ps` manual](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/ps/).

### Debugging container logs[​](#debugging-container-logs "Direct link to Debugging container logs")

Docker may generate a runtime error.

The error may not be accurate, as the true culprit is often indicated higher up
in the logs.

To see the full log, retrieve the UUID - also known as the `CONTAINER ID` -
using `docker ps`:

Finding the CONTAINER ID

```prism-code
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               ...  
dd363939f261        questdb/questdb     ...
```

Now pass the `CONTAINER ID` - or `dd363939f261` - to the `docker logs` command:

Generating a docker log from a CONTAINER ID

```prism-code
$ docker logs dd363939f261  
No arguments found, start with default arguments  
Running as questdb user  
Log configuration loaded from: /var/lib/questdb/conf/log.conf  
...  
...
```

Note that the log will pull from `/var/lib/questdb/conf/log.conf` by default.

Sharing this log when seeking support for Docker deployments will help us find
the root cause.

## Importing data and sending queries[​](#importing-data-and-sending-queries "Direct link to Importing data and sending queries")

When QuestDB is running, you can start interacting with it:

* Port `9000` is for REST. More info is available on the
  [REST documentation page](/docs/query/rest-api/).
* Port `8812` is used for Postgres. Check our
  [Postgres reference page](/docs/query/pgwire/overview/).
* Port `9009` is dedicated to InfluxDB Line Protocol. Consult our
  [InfluxDB protocol page](/docs/ingestion/ilp/overview/).

## Data persistence[​](#data-persistence "Direct link to Data persistence")

### Mounting a volume[​](#mounting-a-volume "Direct link to Mounting a volume")

Volumes can be mounted to the QuestDB Docker container so that data may be
persisted or server configuration settings may be passed to an instance. The
following example demonstrated how to mount the current directory to a QuestDB
container using the `-v` flag in a Docker `run` command:

Mounting a volume

```prism-code
docker run -p 9000:9000 \  
-p 9009:9009 \  
-p 8812:8812 \  
-p 9003:9003 \  
-v "$(pwd):/var/lib/questdb" \  
questdb/questdb:9.3.1
```

The current directory will then have data persisted to disk for convenient
migration or backups:

Current directory contents

```prism-code
├── conf  
│   └── server.conf  
├── db  
├── log  
├── public  
└── snapshot (optional)
```

A server configuration file can also be provided by mounting a local directory
in a QuestDB container. Given the following configuration file which overrides
the default HTTP bind property:

./server.conf

```prism-code
http.bind.to=0.0.0.0:4000
```

Running the container with the `-v` flag allows for mounting the current
directory to QuestDB's `conf` directory in the container. With the server
configuration above, HTTP ports for the [Web Console](/docs/getting-started/web-console/overview/) and REST API will be
available on `http://localhost:4000`:

```prism-code
docker run -v "$(pwd):/var/lib/questdb/conf" -p 4000:4000 questdb/questdb
```

note

If you wish to use ZFS for your QuestDB deployment, with Docker, then you will need to enable ZFS on the host volume that Docker uses.

Please see the [docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/storage/storagedriver/zfs-driver/) for more information.

### Upgrade QuestDB version[​](#upgrade-questdb-version "Direct link to Upgrade QuestDB version")

It is possible to upgrade your QuestDB instance on Docker when a volume is
mounted to maintain data persistence.

note

* Check the [release notes](https://github.com/questdb/questdb/releases) and
  ensure that necessary [backup](/docs/operations/backup/) is completed.
* Upgrading an instance is possible only when the original instance has a volume
  mounted. Without mounting a volume for the original instance, the following
  steps create a new instance and data in the old instance cannot be retrieved.

1. Run `docker ps` to copy the container name or ID:

Container status

```prism-code
# The existing QuestDB version is 6.5.2:  
  
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                    COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                NAMES  
dd363939f261        questdb/questdb:6.5.2     "/app/bin/java -m io…"   3 seconds ago       Up 2 seconds        8812/tcp, 9000/tcp   frosty_gauss
```

2. Stop the instance and then remove the container:

```prism-code
docker stop dd363939f261  
docker rm dd363939f261
```

3. Download the latest QuestDB image:

```prism-code
docker pull questdb/questdb:9.3.1
```

4. Start a new container with the new version and the same volume mounted:

```prism-code
docker run -p 8812:8812 -p 9000:9000 -v "$(pwd):/var/lib/questdb" questdb/questdb:9.3.1
```

### Writing logs to disk[​](#writing-logs-to-disk "Direct link to Writing logs to disk")

When mounting a volume to a Docker container, a logging configuration file may
be provided in the container located at `/conf/log.conf`:

Current directory contents

```prism-code
└── conf  
    ├── log.conf  
    └── server.conf
```

For example, a file with the following contents can be created:

./conf/log.conf

```prism-code
# list of configured writers  
writers=file,stdout,http.min  
  
# file writer  
w.file.class=io.questdb.log.LogFileWriter  
w.file.location=questdb-docker.log  
w.file.level=INFO,ERROR,DEBUG  
  
# stdout  
w.stdout.class=io.questdb.log.LogConsoleWriter  
w.stdout.level=INFO  
  
# min http server, used monitoring  
w.http.min.class=io.questdb.log.LogConsoleWriter  
w.http.min.level=ERROR  
w.http.min.scope=http-min-server
```

The current directory can be mounted:

Mounting the current directory to a QuestDB container

```prism-code
docker run -p 9000:9000 \  
 -p 9009:9009 \  
 -p 8812:8812 \  
 -p 9003:9003 \  
 -v "$(pwd):/root/.questdb/" questdb/questdb
```

The container logs will be written to disk using the logging level and file name
provided in the `conf/log.conf` file, in this case in `./questdb-docker.log`:

Current directory tree

```prism-code
├── conf  
│  ├── log.conf  
│  └── server.conf  
├── db  
│  ├── table1  
│  └── table2  
├── public  
│  ├── ui / assets  
│  ├── ...  
│  └── version.txt  
└── questdb-docker.log
```

For more information on logging, see the
[configuration reference documentation](/docs/operations/logging-metrics/#docker-logging).

### Restart an existing container[​](#restart-an-existing-container "Direct link to Restart an existing container")

Running the following command will create a new container for the QuestDB image:

```prism-code
docker run -p 9000:9000 \  
  -p 9009:9009 \  
  -p 8812:8812 \  
  -p 9003:9003 \  
  questdb/questdb
```

By giving the container a name with `--name container_name`, we have an easy way
to refer to the container created by run later on:

```prism-code
docker run -p 9000:9000 \  
  -p 9009:9009 \  
  -p 8812:8812 \  
  -p 9003:9003 \  
  --name docker_questdb \  
  questdb/questdb
```

If we want to re-use this container and its data after it has been stopped, we
can use the following commands:

```prism-code
# bring the container up  
docker start docker_questdb  
# shut the container down  
docker stop docker_questdb
```

Alternatively, restart it using the `CONTAINER ID`:

Starting a container by CONTAINER ID

```prism-code
docker start dd363939f261
```
