## Hardware recommendations[​](#hardware-recommendations "Direct link to Hardware recommendations")

#### CPU/RAM[​](#cpuram "Direct link to CPU/RAM")

A production instance for QuestDB should be provisioned with at least `4 vCPUs` and `8 GiB` of memory. If possible,
a 1:4 `vCPU/RAM` ratio should be used. Some use cases may benefit from a `1:8` ratio, if this means that all the working
set data will fit into memory; this can increase query performance by as much as `10x`.

It is **not recommended** to run production workloads on less than `4 vCPUs`, as below this number, parallel querying optimisations
may be disabled. This is to ensure there is sufficient resources available for ingestion.

#### Architecture[​](#architecture "Direct link to Architecture")

QuestDB should be deployed on Intel/AMD architectures i.e. `x86_64` and **not** on `ARM` i.e. `aarch64`. Some optimisations are not available
on `ARM`, e.g. `SIMD`.

#### Storage[​](#storage "Direct link to Storage")

Data should be stored on a data disk with at minimum 3000 IOPS/125 MBps, and ideally at least 5000 IOPS/300 MBps.
Higher end workloads should scale up the disks appropriately, or use multiple disks if necessary.

It is also worth checking the burst capacity of your storage. This capacity should only be used during
heavy I/O spikes/infrequent out-of-order (O3) writes. It is useful to have in case you hit unexpected load bursts.

### Azure Virtual Machines with Azure Managed Disk[​](#azure-virtual-machines-with-azure-managed-disk "Direct link to Azure Virtual Machines with Azure Managed Disk")

Azure Virtual Machines have a naming convention that is handy for finding compatible instances.

**Do not** use instances with the letter `p`. These are `ARM` architecture instances, usually running
on `Cobalt` chips.

**Do** use instances with the letter `s`. This indicates that it is compatible with `Premium SSD` storage,
preferred for QuestDB.

Either `AMD EPYC` CPUs (`a` letter) or `Intel Xeon` (no letter) are appropriate for `x86_64` deployments.

We recommend starting with `D-series` instances, and then later upgrading to `E-series` if necessary i.e. for more RAM.

You should deploy using an `x86_64` Linux distribution, such as Ubuntu.

For storage, we recommend using [Premium SSD v2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/disks-types#premium-ssd-v2) disks,
and provisioning them at `5000 IOPS/300 MBps` until you have tested your workload.

note

`Premium SSD v2` disks only support locally-redundant storage (LRS). For Enterprise users, this
is not an issue, as your data is secured using replication over Azure Blob Storage.

For open-source users, you may want to:

* downgrade to `Premium SSD` storage, which supports zone-redundant storage (ZRS).
* or publish to multiple instances
* or take frequent ZRS snapshots of your LRS disk.

For the file system, use `zfs` with `lz4`, as this will compress your data. If compression
is not a concern, then use `ext4` or `xfs` for a little higher performance.

warning

QuestDB does **not** support `blobfuse2`. Please use the above recommendations, or refer to [capacity planning](/docs/getting-started/capacity-planning/)

### Azure NetApp Files[​](#azure-netapp-files "Direct link to Azure NetApp Files")

Azure NetAppFiles is a volume-as-a-service (VaaS) offering from Microsoft, supporting an NFS API.

This should **not** be used as primary storage for QuestDB, but could be used as an object store for Enterprise replication.

We would recommend using `Azure Blob Storage` instead as a simpler, and cheaper, alternative.

### Azure Blob Storage[​](#azure-blob-storage "Direct link to Azure Blob Storage")

QuestDB supports `Azure Blob Storage` as its replication object-store in the Enterprise edition.

To get started, use `Azure Storage Explorer` to create new `Blob Container`, and then follow the
[Enterprise Quick Start](/docs/getting-started/enterprise-quick-start/) steps to create a connection string and
configure QuestDB.

### Minimum specification[​](#minimum-specification "Direct link to Minimum specification")

* **Instance**: `D4as v5` or `D4s v5` `(4 vCPUs, 16 GiB RAM)`
* **Storage**
  + **OS disk**: `Premium SSD v2 (30 GiB)` volume provisioned with `3000 IOPS/125 MBps`.
  + **Data disk**: `Premium SSD v2 (100 GiB)` volume provisioned with `3000 IOPS/125 MBps`.
* **Operating System**: `Linux Ubuntu 24.04 LTS x86_64`.
* **File System**: `ext4`

note

If you use `Premium SSD` instead of `Premium SSD v2`, you should start with a `P20` size (`512 GiB`).
This offers `2300 IOPS/150 MBps` which should be enough for basic workloads.

### Better specification[​](#better-specification "Direct link to Better specification")

* **Instance**: `E8as v5`or `E8s v5` `(8 vCPUs, 64 GiB RAM)`
* **Storage**
  + **OS disk**: `Premium SSD v2 (30 GiB)` volume provisioned with `5000 IOPS/300 MBps`.
  + **Data disk**: `Premium SSD v2 (300 GiB)` volume provisioned with `5000 IOPS/300 MBps`.
* **Operating System**: `Linux Ubuntu 24.04 LTS x86_64`.
* **File System**: `zfs`

note

If you use `Premium SSD` instead of `Premium SSD v2`, you should upgrade to a `P30` size disk (`1 TiB`).
This offers `5000 IOPS/200 MBps` which should be enough for higher workloads.

## Launching QuestDB on Azure Virtual Machines[​](#launching-questdb-on-azure-virtual-machines "Direct link to Launching QuestDB on Azure Virtual Machines")

This guide demonstrates how to spin up a Microsoft Azure Virtual Machine that is
running QuestDB on Ubuntu. This will help get you comfortable with Azure VM
basics.

### Prerequisites[​](#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")

* A [Microsoft Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/) with billing
  enabled. Adding a credit card is required to create an account, but this demo
  will only use resources in the free tier.

### Create an Azure VM[​](#create-an-azure-vm "Direct link to Create an Azure VM")

1. In the Azure console, navigate to the **Virtual Machines** page. Once you are
   on this page, click the **Create** dropdown in the top left-hand corner of
   the screen and select the **Azure virtual machine** option.
2. From here, fill out the required options. If you don't already have a
   **Resource group**, you can create one on this page. We made a "default"
   group for this example, but you are free to choose any name you like. Enter
   the name of your new virtual machine, as well as its desired Region and
   Availability Zone. Your dialog should look something like this:

Click to zoom

3. Scroll down and select your desired instance type. In this case, we used a
   `Standard_B1s` to take advantage of Azure's free tier.
4. If you don't already have one, create a new SSH key pair to securely connect
   to the instance once it has been created.

![The Create Instance dialog on Microsoft Azure, continued](/docs/images/guides/microsoft-azure-ubuntu/ssh-setup.webp)

Click to zoom

5. We will use Azure defaults for the rest of the VM's settings. Click
   **Review + create** to confirm your settings, then **Create** to download
   your new key pair and launch the instance.

Click to zoom

Once you see this screen, click the **Go to resource** button and move on to the
next section

### Set up networking[​](#set-up-networking "Direct link to Set up networking")

We now need to set up the appropriate firewall rules which will allow you to
connect to your new QuestDB instance over the several protocols that we support.

1. In the **Settings** sidebar, click the **Networking** button. This will lead
   you to a page with all firewall rules for your instance. To open up the
   required ports, click the **Add inbound port rule** on the right-hand side.
2. Change the **Destination port ranges** to the `8812,9000,9003`, set the
   **Protocol** to `TCP`, change the name to `questdb`, and click the **Add**
   button. This will add the appropriate ingress rules to your instance's
   firewall. It may take a few seconds, and possibly a page refresh, but you
   should see your new firewall rule in the list. Port 8812 is used for the
   postgresql protocol, port 9000 is used for the web interface, the REST API,
   and ILP ingestion over HTTP. Port 9003 is used for metrics and health check.

### Install QuestDB[​](#install-questdb "Direct link to Install QuestDB")

Now that you've opened up the required ports, it's time to install and run
QuestDB. To do this, you first need to connect to your instance over SSH. Since
we named our SSH key `questdb_key`, this is the filename that the commands below
use. You should substitute this with your own key name that you downloaded in
the previous step. You also need to use your VM's external IP address instead of
the placeholder that we have provided.

We first need to adjust the permissions on the downloaded file, and then use it
to ssh into your instance.

```prism-code
export YOUR_INSTANCE_IP=172.xxx.xxx.xxx  
chmod 400 ~/download/questdb_key.pem  
ssh -i ~/download/questdb_key.pem azureuser@$YOUR_INSTANCE_IP
```

Once we've connected to the instance, we will use `wget`
to download the QuestDB binary, extract it, and run the start script. Please visit
the Ubuntu section at the [binary installation page](https://questdb.com/download/) to make sure you are using the latest
version of the binary package and replace the URL below as appropriate.

```prism-code
wget https://github.com/questdb/questdb/releases/download/9.3.1/questdb-9.3.1-rt-linux-x86-64.tar.gz  
tar -xvf questdb-9.3.1-rt-linux-x86-64.tar.gz  
cd questdb-9.3.1-rt-linux-x86-64/bin  
./questdb.sh start
```

Once you've run these commands, you should be able to navigate to your instance
at its IP on port 9000: `http://$YOUR_INSTANCE_IP:9000`
