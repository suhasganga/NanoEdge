QuestDB can use [ZFS](https://openzfs.org/wiki/Main_Page) for system-level
compression, reducing disk usage without application changes.

The following example shows how to set up ZFS on Ubuntu:

Ubuntu - Install ZFS

```prism-code
sudo apt update  
sudo apt install zfsutils-linux
```

To enable compression, create a ZPool with compression enabled:

Ubuntu - Enable compression

```prism-code
zpool create -m legacy -o feature@lz4_compress=enabled -o autoexpand=on -O compression=lz4 -t volume1 questdb-pool sdf
```

The exact commands depend on which version of ZFS you are running. Use the
[ZFS docs](https://openzfs.github.io/openzfs-docs/man/master/8/zpool-create.8.html)
to customize your ZFS to meet your requirements.

Once created, ZFS provides system-level compression.

## Compression choices, LZ4 and zstd[​](#compression-choices-lz4-and-zstd "Direct link to Compression choices, LZ4 and zstd")

ZFS offers a number of compression choices when constructing the volume.

[LZ4](https://github.com/lz4/lz4) offers a good balance of compression ratio versus increased CPU usage, and slowed performance. For general usage, we recommend using LZ4.

[zstd](https://github.com/facebook/zstd) is another strong option. This will provide higher compression ratios, but take longer to decompress. We recommend this when storage size is an absolute priority, or for embedded-style deployments (i.e. Raspberry Pi, home IoT setups).

As always, it is best to benchmark your choice to ensure that the performance matches your use case.

note

We regularly test ZFS with LZ4 compression. If you encounter issues with other
compression algorithms, please let us know.
