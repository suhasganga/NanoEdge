Tune replication for lower latency or reduced network costs.

[Learn more](https://questdb.com/enterprise/)

Replication tuning lets you balance **latency** against **network costs**. By
default, QuestDB uses balanced settings. You can tune for lower latency or
reduced network traffic depending on your needs.

## When to tune[​](#when-to-tune "Direct link to When to tune")

| Goal | Approach |
| --- | --- |
| **Low latency** | Smaller WAL segments, shorter throttle windows. |
| **Lower network costs** | Larger WAL segments, longer throttle windows. |

## Quick reference[​](#quick-reference "Direct link to Quick reference")

**For low latency**:

```prism-code
cairo.wal.segment.rollover.size=262144  
replication.primary.throttle.window.duration=1000  
replication.primary.sequencer.part.txn.count=5000
```

**For network efficiency**:

```prism-code
cairo.wal.segment.rollover.size=2097152  
replication.primary.throttle.window.duration=60000  
replication.primary.sequencer.part.txn.count=1000
```

## How replication works[​](#how-replication-works "Direct link to How replication works")

Understanding the data flow helps you tune effectively:

1. **Ingestion** - Data is written to Write-Ahead Log (WAL) segments
2. **Upload** - WAL segments are uploaded to object storage
3. **Download** - Replicas download and apply WAL segments

The key insight: **smaller, more frequent uploads = lower latency but more
network traffic**. Larger, less frequent uploads = higher latency but lower
costs.

## Settings explained[​](#settings-explained "Direct link to Settings explained")

### WAL segment size[​](#wal-segment-size "Direct link to WAL segment size")

```prism-code
cairo.wal.segment.rollover.size=2097152
```

Controls when WAL segments are closed and uploaded. Smaller segments upload
sooner (lower latency) but create more files.

| Value | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `262144` (256 KiB) | Lower latency, but more network traffic. |
| `2097152` (2 MiB) | Higher latency, but less network traffic. |

note

Some object stores have minimum file size requirements. AWS S3 Intelligent
Tiering requires files over 128 KiB.

### Throttle window[​](#throttle-window "Direct link to Throttle window")

```prism-code
replication.primary.throttle.window.duration=10000  # 10 seconds (default)
```

Maximum time before uploading incomplete segments. Longer windows let segments
fill up before upload, reducing redundant uploads (write amplification).

| Value | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `1000` (1s) | Lowest latency, most uploads. |
| `10000` (10s) | Default. Balanced. |
| `60000` (60s) | 1 minute delay OK. Fewer uploads. |
| `300000` (5 min) | Cost-sensitive. Batches more data. |

This is your **maximum replication latency tolerance**. QuestDB still actively
manages replication to prevent backlogs during bursts.

### Sequencer part size[​](#sequencer-part-size "Direct link to Sequencer part size")

```prism-code
replication.primary.sequencer.part.txn.count=5000
```

Controls how many transactions are grouped into each sequencer part file.

Instead of uploading the entire transaction log on every replication cycle
(which grows indefinitely), the sequencer is split into fixed-size part files.
Only new or changed parts are uploaded, significantly reducing network overhead.

| Value | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| Lower (e.g. `1000`) | Smaller part files, more frequent new parts, more object storage requests, faster incremental uploads. |
| Higher (e.g. `5000`) | Larger part files, fewer parts, fewer object storage requests, larger per-upload size. |

Default is `5000` (each part ~34-68 KiB compressed).

warning

This setting is **fixed at table creation**. You cannot change it for existing
tables.

## Compression (reference)[​](#compression-reference "Direct link to Compression (reference)")

WAL data is compressed before upload. This isn't tunable, but useful for
estimating storage and network requirements:

| Data type | Compression ratio |
| --- | --- |
| WAL segments | ~8x |
| Sequencer parts | ~6x |

For example, a 2 MiB WAL segment becomes ~256 KiB in object storage.
