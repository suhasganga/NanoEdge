The following document contains a partial list of Operating System (OS) error
codes that can be reported when running QuestDB and brief descriptions for them.

If instead you come across a QuestDB error code (e.g. `ER001`), refer to the [QuestDB Error Codes](/docs/troubleshooting/error-codes/) page.

## Where to find error codes[​](#where-to-find-error-codes "Direct link to Where to find error codes")

QuestDB includes OS error codes into the `[<code>]` part of the exception
message written to the error logs:

```prism-code
io.questdb.cairo.CairoException: [24] could not open read-only [file=/root/.questdb/db/cpu/service.k]
```

The above message reports error code 24 which is "Too many open files" on Linux.

Some error log messages may also include `errno=<code>` key/value pair:

```prism-code
2022-02-01T13:40:10.636014Z E i.q.c.l.t.LineTcpConnectionContext [8655] could not process line data [table=test_table, msg=could not mmap  [size=248, offset=0, fd=1766, memUsed=314809894008, fileLen=8192], errno=12]
```

The above message reports error code 12 which is "Out of memory" on Linux.
