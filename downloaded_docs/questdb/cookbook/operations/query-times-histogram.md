Create a histogram of query execution times using the `_query_trace` system table.

Enable Query Tracing

[Query tracing](/docs/concepts/deep-dive/query-tracing/) needs to be enabled for the `_query_trace` table to be populated.

## Solution: Percentile-based histogram[​](#solution-percentile-based-histogram "Direct link to Solution: Percentile-based histogram")

We can create a subquery that first calculates the percentiles for each bucket, in this case at 10% intervals. Then on a second query we can do a `UNION` of 10 subqueries where each is doing a `CROSS JOIN` against the calculated percentiles and finding how many queries are below the threshold for the bucket.

Note in this case the histogram is cumulative, and each bucket includes the results from the smaller buckets as well. If we prefer non-cumulative, the condition would change from less than to `BETWEEN`.

```prism-code
WITH quantiles AS (  
  SELECT  
    approx_percentile(execution_micros, 0.10, 5) AS p10,  
    approx_percentile(execution_micros, 0.20, 5) AS p20,  
    approx_percentile(execution_micros, 0.30, 5) AS p30,  
    approx_percentile(execution_micros, 0.40, 5) AS p40,  
    approx_percentile(execution_micros, 0.50, 5) AS p50,  
    approx_percentile(execution_micros, 0.60, 5) AS p60,  
    approx_percentile(execution_micros, 0.70, 5) AS p70,  
    approx_percentile(execution_micros, 0.80, 5) AS p80,  
    approx_percentile(execution_micros, 0.90, 5) AS p90,  
    approx_percentile(execution_micros, 1.0, 5)  AS p100  
  FROM _query_trace  
), cumulative_hist AS (  
SELECT '10' AS bucket, p10 as micros_threshold, count(*) AS frequency  
FROM _query_trace CROSS JOIN quantiles  
WHERE execution_micros < p10  
  
UNION ALL  
  
SELECT '20', p20 as micros_threshold,  count(*)  
FROM _query_trace CROSS JOIN quantiles  
WHERE execution_micros < p20  
  
UNION ALL  
  
SELECT '30', p30 as micros_threshold, count(*)  
FROM _query_trace CROSS JOIN quantiles  
WHERE execution_micros < p30  
  
UNION ALL  
  
SELECT '40', p40 as micros_threshold, count(*)  
FROM _query_trace CROSS JOIN quantiles  
WHERE  execution_micros < p40  
  
UNION ALL  
  
SELECT '50', p50 as micros_threshold, count(*)  
FROM _query_trace CROSS JOIN quantiles  
WHERE  execution_micros < p50  
  
UNION ALL  
  
SELECT '60', p60 as micros_threshold, count(*)  
FROM _query_trace CROSS JOIN quantiles  
WHERE  execution_micros < p60  
  
UNION ALL  
  
SELECT '70', p70 as micros_threshold, count(*)  
FROM _query_trace CROSS JOIN quantiles  
WHERE  execution_micros < p70  
  
UNION ALL  
  
SELECT '80', p80 as micros_threshold, count(*)  
FROM _query_trace CROSS JOIN quantiles  
WHERE  execution_micros < p80  
  
UNION ALL  
  
SELECT '90', p90 as micros_threshold, count(*)  
FROM _query_trace CROSS JOIN quantiles  
WHERE  execution_micros < p90  
  
UNION ALL  
  
SELECT '100', p100 as micros_threshold, count(*)  
FROM _query_trace CROSS JOIN quantiles  
 )  
 SELECT * FROM cumulative_hist;
```

**Output:**

```prism-code

"10",215.0,26  
"20",348.0,53  
"30",591.0,80
