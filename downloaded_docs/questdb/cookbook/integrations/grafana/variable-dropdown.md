Create Grafana variable dropdowns where the displayed label differs from the value used in queries. This is useful when you want to show user-friendly names in the dropdown while using different values (like IDs, prices, or technical identifiers) in your actual SQL queries.

## Problem: Separate display and query values[​](#problem-separate-display-and-query-values "Direct link to Problem: Separate display and query values")

You want a Grafana variable dropdown that:

* **Displays:** Readable labels like `"BTC-USDT"`, `"ETH-USDT"`, `"SOL-USDT"`
* **Uses in queries:** Different values like prices (`37779.62`, `2615.54`, `98.23`) or IDs

For example, with this query result:

| symbol | price |
| --- | --- |
| BTC-USDT | 37779.62 |
| ETH-USDT | 2615.54 |
| SOL-USDT | 98.23 |

You want the dropdown to show `"BTC-USDT"` but use `37779.62` in your queries.

## Solution: Use regex variable filters[​](#solution-use-regex-variable-filters "Direct link to Solution: Use regex variable filters")

When using the QuestDB data source plugin, you can use Grafana's regex variable filters to parse a concatenated string into separate `text` and `value` fields.

### Step 1: Concatenate columns in query[​](#step-1-concatenate-columns-in-query "Direct link to Step 1: Concatenate columns in query")

First, combine both columns into a single string with a separator that doesn't appear in your data:

```prism-code
WITH t AS (  
  SELECT symbol, first(price) as price  
  FROM trades  
  WHERE symbol LIKE '%BTC%'  
)  
SELECT concat(symbol, '#', price) FROM t;
```

**Query results:**

```prism-code
DOGE-BTC#0.00000204  
ETH-BTC#0.05551  
BTC-USDT#37779.62  
SOL-BTC#0.0015282  
MATIC-BTC#0.00002074  
BTC-USDC#60511.1
```

Each row is now a single string with symbol and price separated by `#`.

### Step 2: Apply regex filter in Grafana variable[​](#step-2-apply-regex-filter-in-grafana-variable "Direct link to Step 2: Apply regex filter in Grafana variable")

In your Grafana variable configuration:

**Query:**

```prism-code
WITH t AS (  
  SELECT symbol, first(price) as price  
  FROM trades  
  WHERE symbol LIKE '%BTC%'  
)  
SELECT concat(symbol, '#', price) FROM t;
```

**Regex Filter:**

```prism-code
/(?<text>[^#]+)#(?<value>.*)/
```

This regex pattern:

* `(?<text>[^#]+)`: Captures everything before `#` into the `text` group (the display label)
* `#`: Matches the separator
* `(?<value>.*)`: Captures everything after `#` into the `value` group (the query value)

### Step 3: Use variable in queries[​](#step-3-use-variable-in-queries "Direct link to Step 3: Use variable in queries")

Now you can reference the variable in your dashboard queries:

```prism-code
SELECT timestamp, price  
FROM trades  
WHERE price = $your_variable_name  
  AND timestamp >= $__fromTime  
  AND timestamp <= $__toTime;
```

When a user selects "BTC-USDT" from the dropdown, Grafana will substitute the corresponding price value (`37779.62`) into the query.

## How it works[​](#how-it-works "Direct link to How it works")

Grafana's regex filter with named capture groups enables the separation:

1. **Named capture groups**: `(?<text>...)` and `(?<value>...)` tell Grafana which parts to use
2. **`text` group**: Becomes the visible label in the dropdown
3. **`value` group**: Becomes the interpolated value in queries
4. **Pattern matching**: The regex must match the entire string returned by your query

### Regex pattern breakdown[​](#regex-pattern-breakdown "Direct link to Regex pattern breakdown")

```prism-code
/(?<text>[^#]+)#(?<value>.*)/
```

* `/`: Regex delimiters
* `(?<text>...)`: Named capture group called "text"
* `[^#]+`: One or more characters that are NOT `#` (greedy match)
* `#`: Literal separator character
* `(?<value>.*)`: Named capture group called "value"
* `.*`: Zero or more characters of any type (captures rest of string)

## Choosing a separator[​](#choosing-a-separator "Direct link to Choosing a separator")

Pick a separator that **never** appears in your data:

**Good separators:**

* `#` - Uncommon in most data
* `|` - Clear visual separator
* `::` - Two characters, unlikely to appear
* `~` - Rarely used in trading symbols or prices
* `^^^` - Multi-character separator for extra safety

**Bad separators:**

* `-` - Common in trading pairs (BTC-USDT)
* `.` - Common in decimal numbers
* `,` - Common in CSV-like data
* Space - Can cause parsing issues

## Alternative patterns[​](#alternative-patterns "Direct link to Alternative patterns")

### Multiple data fields[​](#multiple-data-fields "Direct link to Multiple data fields")

If you need more than two fields, use additional separators:

```prism-code
SELECT concat(symbol, '#', price, '#', volume) FROM trades;
```

```prism-code
/(?<text>[^#]+)#(?<value>[^#]+)#(?<extra>.*)/
```

Now you have three captured groups, though Grafana's variable system typically only uses `text` and `value`.

### Numeric IDs with descriptions[​](#numeric-ids-with-descriptions "Direct link to Numeric IDs with descriptions")

Common pattern for entity selection:

```prism-code
SELECT concat(name, '#', id) FROM users;
```

```prism-code
/(?<text>[^#]+)#(?<value>\d+)/
```

Output in dropdown: User sees "John Doe", query uses `42`.

### Escaping special characters[​](#escaping-special-characters "Direct link to Escaping special characters")

If your data contains regex special characters, escape them in the pattern:

```prism-code
-- If data contains parentheses  
SELECT concat(name, ' (', id, ')', '#', id) FROM users;  
-- Result: "John Doe (42)#42"
```

```prism-code
/(?<text>.*?)#(?<value>\d+)/
```

## PostgreSQL data source alternative[​](#postgresql-data-source-alternative "Direct link to PostgreSQL data source alternative")

If using the PostgreSQL data source (instead of the QuestDB plugin), you can use special column aliases:

```prism-code
SELECT  
  symbol AS __text,  
  price AS __value  
FROM trades  
WHERE symbol LIKE '%BTC%';
```

The PostgreSQL data source recognizes `__text` and `__value` as special column names for dropdown variables.

**Note:** This works with the PostgreSQL data source plugin pointing to QuestDB, but NOT with the native QuestDB data source plugin.

## Adapting the pattern[​](#adapting-the-pattern "Direct link to Adapting the pattern")

**Different filter conditions:**

```prism-code
-- Filter by time range  
WHERE timestamp IN yesterday()  
  
-- Filter by multiple criteria  
WHERE symbol LIKE '%USDT' AND price > 1000  
  
-- Dynamic filter using another variable  
WHERE symbol LIKE concat('%', $base_currency, '%')
```

**Sorting the dropdown:**

```prism-code
-- Sort alphabetically by symbol  
SELECT concat(symbol, '#', price) FROM trades  
ORDER BY symbol;  
  
-- Sort by price (highest first)  
SELECT concat(symbol, '#', price) FROM trades  
ORDER BY price DESC;  
  
-- Sort by volume  
WITH t AS (  
  SELECT symbol, first(price) as price, sum(amount) as volume  
  FROM trades  
  GROUP BY symbol  
)  
SELECT concat(symbol, '#', price) FROM t  
ORDER BY volume DESC;
```

**Include additional context in label:**

```prism-code
-- Show symbol and volume in the label  
SELECT concat(symbol, ' (Vol: ', round(sum(amount), 2), ')', '#', first(price))  
FROM trades  
GROUP BY symbol;
```

Result: "BTC-USDT (Vol: 1234.56)#37779.62"

## Troubleshooting[​](#troubleshooting "Direct link to Troubleshooting")

**Dropdown shows concatenated string:**

* Verify the regex pattern is correct
* Check that the regex delimiters are `/.../`  (forward slashes)
* Ensure named capture groups are spelled correctly: `(?<text>...)` and `(?<value>...)`

**Variable not interpolating in queries:**

* Verify you're using `$variable_name` syntax in queries
* Check that the variable is defined at the dashboard level
* Test the query manually with a hardcoded value

**Regex not matching:**

* Test your regex pattern with a regex tester (regex101.com)
* Verify your separator doesn't appear in the data itself
* Check for trailing whitespace in query results

**Dropdown is empty:**

* Verify the query returns data
* Check that QuestDB is accessible from Grafana
* Review Grafana logs for error messages

Multi-Select Variables

This pattern works with multi-select variables too. Enable "Multi-value" in the variable configuration, and users can select multiple options. Use `IN ($variable)` in your queries to handle multiple selected values.

Variable Preview

Grafana shows a preview of what the dropdown will look like when you configure the regex filter. Use this to verify your pattern is working correctly before applying it.
