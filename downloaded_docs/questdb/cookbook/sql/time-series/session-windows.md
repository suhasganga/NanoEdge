Calculate sessions and elapsed time by identifying when state changes occur in time-series data. This "flip-flop" or "session" pattern is useful for analyzing user sessions, vehicle rides, machine operating cycles, or any scenario where you need to track duration between state transitions.

## Problem: Track time between state changes[​](#problem-track-time-between-state-changes "Direct link to Problem: Track time between state changes")

You have a table tracking vehicle lock status over time and want to calculate ride duration. A ride starts when `lock_status` changes from `true` (locked) to `false` (unlocked), and ends when it changes back to `true`.

**Table schema:**

```prism-code
CREATE TABLE vehicle_events (  
  vehicle_id SYMBOL,  
  lock_status BOOLEAN,  
  timestamp TIMESTAMP  
) TIMESTAMP(timestamp) PARTITION BY DAY;
```

**Sample data:**

| timestamp | vehicle\_id | lock\_status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 10:00:00 | V001 | true |
| 10:05:00 | V001 | false |
| 10:25:00 | V001 | true |
| 10:30:00 | V001 | false |
| 10:45:00 | V001 | true |

You want to calculate the duration of each ride.

## Solution: Session detection with window functions[​](#solution-session-detection-with-window-functions "Direct link to Solution: Session detection with window functions")

Use window functions to detect state changes, assign session IDs, then calculate durations:

Calculate ride duration from lock status changes

```prism-code
WITH prevEvents AS (  
  SELECT *,  
    lag(lock_status::int) -- lag doesn't support booleans, so we convert to 1 or 0  
      OVER (PARTITION BY vehicle_id ORDER BY timestamp) as prev_status  
  FROM vehicle_events  
  WHERE timestamp IN today()  
),  
ride_sessions AS (  
  SELECT *,  
    SUM(CASE  
      WHEN lock_status = true AND prev_status = 0 THEN 1  
      WHEN lock_status = false AND prev_status = 1 THEN 1  
      ELSE 0  
    END) OVER (PARTITION BY vehicle_id ORDER BY timestamp) as ride  
  FROM prevEvents  
),  
global_sessions AS (  
  SELECT *, concat(vehicle_id, '#', ride) as session  
  FROM ride_sessions  
),  
totals AS (  
  SELECT  
    first(timestamp) as ts,  
    session,  
    FIRST(lock_status) as lock_status,  
    first(vehicle_id) as vehicle_id  
  FROM global_sessions  
  GROUP BY session  
),  
prev_ts AS (  
  SELECT *,  
    lag(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY vehicle_id ORDER BY timestamp) as prev_ts  
  FROM totals  
)  
SELECT  
  timestamp as ride_end,  
  vehicle_id,  
  datediff('s', prev_ts, timestamp) as duration_seconds  
FROM prev_ts  
WHERE lock_status = false AND prev_ts IS NOT NULL;
```

**Results:**

| ride\_end | vehicle\_id | duration\_seconds |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 10:25:00 | V001 | 1200 |
| 10:45:00 | V001 | 900 |

## How it works[​](#how-it-works "Direct link to How it works")

The query uses a five-step approach:

### 1. Get previous status (`prevEvents`)[​](#1-get-previous-status-prevevents "Direct link to 1-get-previous-status-prevevents")

```prism-code
lag(lock_status::int) OVER (PARTITION BY vehicle_id ORDER BY timestamp)
```

For each row, get the status from the previous row. Convert boolean to integer (0/1) since `lag` doesn't support boolean types directly.

### 2. Detect state changes (`ride_sessions`)[​](#2-detect-state-changes-ride_sessions "Direct link to 2-detect-state-changes-ride_sessions")

```prism-code
SUM(CASE WHEN lock_status != prev_status THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)  
  OVER (PARTITION BY vehicle_id ORDER BY timestamp)
```

Whenever status changes, increment a counter. This creates sequential session IDs for each vehicle:

* Ride 0: Initial state
* Ride 1: After first state change
* Ride 2: After second state change
* ...

### 3. Create global session IDs (`global_sessions`)[​](#3-create-global-session-ids-global_sessions "Direct link to 3-create-global-session-ids-global_sessions")

```prism-code
concat(vehicle_id, '#', ride)
```

Combine vehicle\_id with ride number to create unique session identifiers across all vehicles.

### 4. Get session start times (`totals`)[​](#4-get-session-start-times-totals "Direct link to 4-get-session-start-times-totals")

```prism-code
SELECT first(timestamp) as ts, ...  
FROM global_sessions  
GROUP BY session
```

For each session, get the timestamp and status at the beginning of that session.

### 5. Calculate duration (`prev_ts`)[​](#5-calculate-duration-prev_ts "Direct link to 5-calculate-duration-prev_ts")

```prism-code
lag(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY vehicle_id ORDER BY timestamp)
```

Get the timestamp from the previous session (for the same vehicle), then use `datediff('s', prev_ts, timestamp)` to calculate duration in seconds.

### Filter for rides[​](#filter-for-rides "Direct link to Filter for rides")

```prism-code
WHERE lock_status = false
```

Only show sessions where status is `false` (unlocked), which represents completed rides. The duration is from the previous session end (lock) to this session start (unlock).

## Monthly aggregation[​](#monthly-aggregation "Direct link to Monthly aggregation")

Calculate total ride duration per vehicle per month:

Monthly ride duration by vehicle

```prism-code
WITH prevEvents AS (  
  SELECT *,  
    lag(lock_status::int) -- lag doesn't support booleans, so we convert to 1 or 0  
      OVER (PARTITION BY vehicle_id ORDER BY timestamp) as prev_status  
  FROM vehicle_events  
  WHERE timestamp >= dateadd('M', -3, now())  
),  
ride_sessions AS (  
  SELECT *,  
    SUM(CASE  
      WHEN lock_status = true AND prev_status = 0 THEN 1  
      WHEN lock_status = false AND prev_status = 1 THEN 1  
      ELSE 0  
    END) OVER (PARTITION BY vehicle_id ORDER BY timestamp) as ride  
  FROM prevEvents  
),  
global_sessions AS (  
  SELECT *, concat(vehicle_id, '#', ride) as session  
  FROM ride_sessions  
),  
totals AS (  
  SELECT  
    first(timestamp) as ts,  
    session,  
    FIRST(lock_status) as lock_status,  
    first(vehicle_id) as vehicle_id  
  FROM global_sessions  
  GROUP BY session  
),  
prev_ts AS (  
  SELECT *,  
    lag(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY vehicle_id ORDER BY timestamp) as prev_ts  
  FROM totals  
)  
SELECT  
  timestamp_floor('M', timestamp) as month,  
  vehicle_id,  
  SUM(datediff('s', prev_ts, timestamp)) as total_ride_duration_seconds,  
  COUNT(*) as ride_count  
FROM prev_ts  
WHERE lock_status = false AND prev_ts IS NOT NULL  
GROUP BY month, vehicle_id  
ORDER BY month, vehicle_id;
```

## Adapting to different use cases[​](#adapting-to-different-use-cases "Direct link to Adapting to different use cases")

**User website sessions (1 hour timeout):**

```prism-code
WITH prevEvents AS (  
  SELECT *,  
    lag(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY timestamp) as prev_ts  
  FROM page_views  
),  
sessions AS (  
  SELECT *,  
    SUM(CASE  
      WHEN datediff('h', prev_ts, timestamp) > 1 THEN 1  
      ELSE 0  
    END) OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY timestamp) as session_id  
  FROM prevEvents  
)  
SELECT  
  user_id,  
  session_id,  
  min(timestamp) as session_start,  
  max(timestamp) as session_end,  
  datediff('s', min(timestamp), max(timestamp)) as session_duration_seconds,  
  count(*) as page_views  
FROM sessions  
GROUP BY user_id, session_id;
```

**Machine operating cycles:**

```prism-code
-- When machine changes from 'off' to 'running' to 'off'  
WITH prevStatus AS (  
  SELECT *,  
    lag(status) OVER (PARTITION BY machine_id ORDER BY timestamp) as prev_status  
  FROM machine_status  
),  
cycles AS (  
  SELECT *,  
    SUM(CASE  
      WHEN status != prev_status THEN 1  
      ELSE 0  
    END) OVER (PARTITION BY machine_id ORDER BY timestamp) as cycle  
  FROM prevStatus  
)  
SELECT  
  machine_id,  
  cycle,  
  min(timestamp) as cycle_start,  
  max(timestamp) as cycle_end  
FROM cycles  
WHERE status = 'running'  
GROUP BY machine_id, cycle;
```

Common Session Patterns

This pattern applies to many scenarios:

* **User sessions**: Time between last action and timeout
* **IoT device cycles**: Power on/off cycles
* **Vehicle trips**: Ignition on/off periods
* **Connection sessions**: Login/logout tracking
* **Process steps**: Start/complete state transitions

First Row Handling

The first row in each partition will have `NULL` for previous values. Always filter these out with `WHERE prev_ts IS NOT NULL` or similar conditions.
