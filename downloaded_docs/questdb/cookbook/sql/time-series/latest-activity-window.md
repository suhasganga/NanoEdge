Query data from the last N minutes of recorded activity in a table, regardless of the current time.

## Problem[​](#problem "Direct link to Problem")

You want to get data from a table for the last 15 minutes of activity.

You know you could do:

```prism-code
SELECT * FROM my_tb  
WHERE timestamp > dateadd('m', -15, now());
```

But that would give you the last 15 minutes, not the last 15 minutes of activity in your table. Assuming the last timestamp recorded in your table was `2025-03-23T07:24:37.000000Z`, then you would like to get the data from `2025-03-23T07:09:37.000000Z` to `2025-03-23T07:24:37.000000Z`.

## Solution[​](#solution "Direct link to Solution")

Use a correlated subquery to find the latest timestamp, then filter relative to it:

Last 15 minutes of recorded activity

```prism-code
SELECT *  
FROM my_table  
WHERE timestamp >= (  
  SELECT dateadd('m', -15, timestamp)  
  FROM my_table  
  LIMIT -1  
);
```

QuestDB supports correlated subqueries when asking for a timestamp if the query returns a scalar value. Using `LIMIT -1` we get the latest row in the table (sorted by designated timestamp), and we apply the `dateadd` function on that date, so it needs to be executed just once. If we placed the `dateadd` on the left, the calculation would need to be applied once for each row on the main table. This query should return in just a few milliseconds, independently of table size.
