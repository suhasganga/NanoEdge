Calculate the cumulative Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) for intraday trading analysis. VWAP is a trading benchmark that represents the average price at which an asset has traded throughout the day, weighted by volume. It's widely used by institutional traders to assess execution quality and identify trend strength.

## Problem: Calculate running VWAP[​](#problem-calculate-running-vwap "Direct link to Problem: Calculate running VWAP")

You want to calculate the cumulative VWAP for a trading day, where each point shows the average price weighted by volume from market open until that moment. This helps traders determine if current prices are above or below the day's volume-weighted average.

## Solution: Use typical price from OHLC data[​](#solution-use-typical-price-from-ohlc-data "Direct link to Solution: Use typical price from OHLC data")

The industry standard for VWAP uses the **typical price** formula from OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) candles:

```prism-code
Typical Price = (High + Low + Close) / 3  
VWAP = Σ(Typical Price × Volume) / Σ(Volume)
```

This approximation is used because most trading platforms work with OHLC data rather than tick-level trades. We use the `fx_trades_ohlc_1m` materialized view which provides 1-minute candles:

  SELECT  
    timestamp, symbol,  
    total_volume,  
    ((high + low + close) / 3) * total_volume AS traded_value  
  FROM fx_trades_ohlc_1m  
  WHERE timestamp IN yesterday() AND symbol = 'EURUSD'  
),

    SUM(total_volume) OVER (ORDER BY timestamp) AS cumulative_volume  
  FROM sampled  
)  
SELECT timestamp, symbol, cumulative_value / cumulative_volume AS vwap  
FROM cumulative;
```

This query:

1. Reads 1-minute OHLC candles and calculates typical price × volume for each candle
2. Uses window functions to compute running totals of both traded value and volume
3. Divides cumulative traded value by cumulative volume to get VWAP at each timestamp

## How it works[​](#how-it-works "Direct link to How it works")

The key insight is using `SUM(...) OVER (ORDER BY timestamp)` to create running totals:

* `cumulative_value`: Running sum of (typical price × volume) from market open
* `cumulative_volume`: Running sum of volume from market open
* Final VWAP: Dividing these cumulative values gives the volume-weighted average at each point

When using `SUM() OVER (ORDER BY timestamp)` without specifying a frame clause, QuestDB defaults to summing from the first row to the current row, which is exactly what we need for cumulative VWAP.

## Multiple symbols[​](#multiple-symbols "Direct link to Multiple symbols")

To calculate VWAP for multiple symbols simultaneously, add `PARTITION BY symbol` to the window functions:

```prism-code
WITH sampled AS (  
  SELECT  
    timestamp, symbol,  
    total_volume,  
    ((high + low + close) / 3) * total_volume AS traded_value  
  FROM fx_trades_ohlc_1m  
  WHERE timestamp IN yesterday()  
    AND symbol IN ('EURUSD', 'GBPUSD', 'USDJPY')  
),  
cumulative AS (  
  SELECT  
    timestamp, symbol,  
    SUM(traded_value) OVER (PARTITION BY symbol ORDER BY timestamp) AS cumulative_value,  
    SUM(total_volume) OVER (PARTITION BY symbol ORDER BY timestamp) AS cumulative_volume  
  FROM sampled  
)  
SELECT timestamp, symbol, cumulative_value / cumulative_volume AS vwap  
FROM cumulative;
```

The `PARTITION BY symbol` ensures each symbol's VWAP is calculated independently, resetting the cumulative sums for each symbol.

## Different time ranges[​](#different-time-ranges "Direct link to Different time ranges")

```prism-code
-- Current trading day  
WHERE timestamp IN today()  
  
-- Specific date  
WHERE timestamp IN '2026-01-12'  
  
-- Last hour  
WHERE timestamp >= dateadd('h', -1, now())
```

Trading use cases

* **Execution quality**: Institutional traders compare their execution prices against VWAP to assess trade quality
* **Trend identification**: Price consistently above VWAP suggests bullish momentum; below suggests bearish
* **Support/resistance**: VWAP often acts as dynamic support or resistance during the trading day
* **Mean reversion**: Traders use deviations from VWAP to identify potential reversal points
