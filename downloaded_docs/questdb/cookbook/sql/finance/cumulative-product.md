Calculate the cumulative product of daily returns to simulate a stock's price path (random walk). This is useful for financial modeling, backtesting trading strategies, and portfolio analysis where you need to compound returns over time.

## Problem: Compound daily returns[​](#problem-compound-daily-returns "Direct link to Problem: Compound daily returns")

You have a table with daily returns for a stock and want to calculate the cumulative price starting from an initial value (e.g., $100). Each day's price is calculated by multiplying the previous price by `(1 + return)`.

For example, with these daily returns:

| Date | Daily Return (%) |
| --- | --- |
| 2024-09-05 | 2.00 |
| 2024-09-06 | -1.00 |
| 2024-09-07 | 1.50 |
| 2024-09-08 | -3.00 |

You want to calculate:

| Date | Daily Return (%) | Stock Price |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2024-09-05 | 2.00 | 102.00 |
| 2024-09-06 | -1.00 | 100.98 |
| 2024-09-07 | 1.50 | 102.49 |
| 2024-09-08 | -3.00 | 99.42 |

## Solution: Use logarithms to convert multiplication to addition[​](#solution-use-logarithms-to-convert-multiplication-to-addition "Direct link to Solution: Use logarithms to convert multiplication to addition")

Use the mathematical identity: **exp(sum(ln(x))) = product(x)**

This converts the cumulative product into a cumulative sum, which window functions handle naturally:

Calculate cumulative product via logarithms

```prism-code
WITH ln_values AS (  
    SELECT  
        date,  
        return,  
        SUM(ln(1 + return)) OVER (ORDER BY date) AS ln_value  
    FROM daily_returns  
)  
SELECT  
    date,  
    return,  
    100 * exp(ln_value) AS stock_price  
FROM ln_values;
```

This query:

1. Calculates `ln(1 + return)` for each day
2. Uses a cumulative `SUM` window function to add up the logarithms
3. Applies `exp()` to convert back to the product

## How it works[​](#how-it-works "Direct link to How it works")

The mathematical identity used here is:

```prism-code
product(1 + r₁, 1 + r₂, ..., 1 + rₙ) = exp(sum(ln(1 + r₁), ln(1 + r₂), ..., ln(1 + rₙ)))
```

Breaking it down:

* `ln(1 + return)` converts each multiplicative factor to an additive one
* `SUM(...) OVER (ORDER BY date)` creates a cumulative sum
* `exp(ln_value)` converts the cumulative sum back to a cumulative product
* Multiply by 100 to apply the starting price of $100

## Adapting to your data[​](#adapting-to-your-data "Direct link to Adapting to your data")

You can easily modify this pattern:

**Different starting price:**

```prism-code
SELECT date, return, 1000 * exp(ln_value) AS stock_price  -- Start at $1000  
FROM ln_values;
```

**Different time granularity:**

```prism-code
-- For hourly returns  
WITH ln_values AS (  
    SELECT  
        timestamp,  
        return,  
        SUM(ln(1 + return)) OVER (ORDER BY timestamp) AS ln_value  
    FROM hourly_returns  
)  
SELECT timestamp, 100 * exp(ln_value) AS price FROM ln_values;
```

**Multiple assets:**

```prism-code
WITH ln_values AS (  
    SELECT  
        date,  
        symbol,  
        return,  
        SUM(ln(1 + return)) OVER (PARTITION BY symbol ORDER BY date) AS ln_value  
    FROM daily_returns  
)  
SELECT  
    date,  
    symbol,  
    100 * exp(ln_value) AS stock_price  
FROM ln_values;
```

Use Case: Monte Carlo Simulation

This pattern is essential for Monte Carlo simulations in finance. Generate random returns, apply this cumulative product calculation, and run thousands of iterations to model possible future price paths.
