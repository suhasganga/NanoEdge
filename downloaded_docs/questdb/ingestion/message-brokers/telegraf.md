[Telegraf](https://docs.influxdata.com/telegraf/v1.17/) is a client for
collecting metrics from many inputs and has support for sending it on to various
outputs. It is plugin-driven for the collection and delivery of data, so it is
easily configurable and customizable. Telegraf is compiled as a standalone
binary, which means there are no external dependencies required to manage.

QuestDB supports ingesting from Telegraf via the InfluxDB Line Protocol. This
page provides examples for collecting CPU and memory usage metrics using
Telegraf and sends these metrics to a locally-running QuestDB instance for
querying and visualization.

## Prerequisites[​](#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")

* **QuestDB** must be running and accessible. Checkout the
  [quick start](/docs/getting-started/quick-start/).
* **Telegraf** can be installed using
  [homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/telegraf),
  [docker](https://hub.docker.com/_/telegraf), or directly as a binary. For more
  details, refer to the official Telegraf
  [installation instructions](https://docs.influxdata.com/telegraf/v1.17/introduction/installation/).

## Configuring Telegraf[​](#configuring-telegraf "Direct link to Configuring Telegraf")

As Telegraf is a plugin-driven agent, the configuration file provided when
Telegraf is launched will determine which metrics to collect, if and how
processing of the metrics should be performed, and the destination outputs.

The default location that Telegraf can pick up configuration files is
`/usr/local/etc/` on macOS and `/etc/telegraf/` on Linux. After installation,
default configuration files are in the following locations:

* Homebrew install: `/usr/local/etc/telegraf.conf`
* Linux, Deb and RPM: `/etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf`

Full configuration files for writing are provided below and can be placed in
these directories and picked up by Telegraf. To view a comprehensive
configuration file with example inputs and outputs, the following command can
generate an example:

```prism-code
telegraf -sample-config > example.conf
```

### Example Inputs[​](#example-inputs "Direct link to Example Inputs")

The examples on this page will use input plugins that read CPU and memory usage
statistics of the host machine and send this to the outputs specified in the
configuration file. The following snippet includes code comments which describe
the inputs in more detail:

Example inputs sending host data to QuestDB

```prism-code
...  
# -- INPUT PLUGINS -- #  
[[inputs.cpu]]  
  # Read metrics about cpu usage  
  ## Whether to report per-cpu stats or not  
  percpu = true  
  ## Whether to report total system cpu stats or not  
  totalcpu = true  
  ## If true, collect raw CPU time metrics  
  collect_cpu_time = false  
  ## If true, compute and report the sum of all non-idle CPU states  
  report_active = false  
  
# Read metrics about memory usage  
[[inputs.mem]]  
  # no customisation
```

## Writing to QuestDB over HTTP[​](#writing-to-questdb-over-http "Direct link to Writing to QuestDB over HTTP")

QuestDB expects Influx Line Protocol messages over HTTP on port `9000`. To change
the default port, see the [HTTP server configuration](/docs/configuration/overview/#http-server)
section of the server configuration page.

Create a new file named `questdb.conf` in one of the locations Telegraf can
load configuration files from and paste the following example:

/path/to/telegraf/config/questdb.conf

```prism-code
# Configuration for Telegraf agent  
[agent]  
  ## Default data collection interval for all inputs  
  interval = "5s"  
  hostname = "qdb"  
  
# -- OUTPUT PLUGINS -- #  
[[outputs.influxdb_v2]]  
# Use InfluxDB Line Protocol to write metrics to QuestDB  
  urls = ["http://localhost:9000"]  
# Disable gzip compression  
  content_encoding = "identity"  
  
# -- INPUT PLUGINS -- #  
[[inputs.cpu]]  
  percpu = true  
  totalcpu = true  
  collect_cpu_time = false  
  report_active = false  
[[inputs.mem]]  
  # no customisation
```

Optionally, we recommend applying an aggregator plugin.

The InfluxDB Line Protocol default in many cases will lead to data in the form
of multiple, fairly sparse rows.

QuestDB prefers rows that are **"more dense"**.

To that end, the aggregator plugin takes all the metrics for the same tag -
equivalent to a symbol - and the timestamp. It then outputs them into single
row. If metrics are arriving in the usual ILP style with a metric per tag, the
aggregator plugin will instead roll them into a more "dense" row as desired.

/path/to/telegraf/config/questdb.conf - Aggregator plugin

```prism-code
# -- AGGREGATOR PLUGINS ------------------------------------------------- #  
# Merge metrics into multifield metrics by series key  
[[aggregators.merge]]  
  ## If true, the original metric will be dropped by the  
  ## aggregator and will not get sent to the output plugins.  
  drop_original = true
```

Run Telegraf and specify the configuration file with the QuestDB output:

```prism-code
telegraf --config questdb.conf
```

Telegraf should report the following if configured correctly:

```prism-code
2021-01-29T12:11:32Z I! Loaded inputs: cpu mem  
2021-01-29T12:11:32Z I! Loaded aggregators:  
2021-01-29T12:11:32Z I! Loaded processors:  
2021-01-29T12:11:32Z I! Loaded outputs: influxdb_v2  
...
```

## Verifying the integration[​](#verifying-the-integration "Direct link to Verifying the integration")

1. Navigate to the QuestDB [Web Console](/docs/getting-started/web-console/overview/) at `http://127.0.0.1:9000/`. The Schema
   Navigator in the top left should display two new tables:

* `cpu` generated from `inputs.cpu`
* `mem` generated from `inputs.mem`

2. Type `cpu` in the query editor and click **RUN**

The `cpu` table will have a column for each metric collected by the Telegraf
plugin for monitoring memory:

### Graphing system CPU[​](#graphing-system-cpu "Direct link to Graphing system CPU")

To create a graph that visualizes CPU usage over time, run the following example
query:

```prism-code
SELECT  
avg(usage_system) cpu_average,  
max(usage_system) cpu_max,  
timestamp  
FROM cpu SAMPLE BY 1m;
```

Select the **Chart** tab and set the following values:

* Chart type **line**
* Labels **timestamp**
* Series **cpu\_average** and **cpu\_max**
