CSV import is for bulk/batch loading. For streaming data, use
[InfluxDB Line Protocol (ILP)](/docs/ingestion/overview/) instead.

There are three methods for CSV import:

1. [COPY SQL](#import-csv-via-copy-sql) - Best for large files and migrations
2. [REST API](#import-csv-via-rest) - For programmatic uploads of smaller files
3. [Web Console](/docs/getting-started/web-console/import-csv/) - Interactive uploads via browser

## Import CSV via COPY SQL[​](#import-csv-via-copy-sql "Direct link to Import CSV via COPY SQL")

The [COPY](/docs/query/sql/copy/) SQL command is the preferred way to import
large CSV files into partitioned tables. Use it for bulk data migrations from
other databases.

For partitioned tables, the best `COPY` performance can be achieved only on a
machine with a local, physically attached SSD. It is possible to use a network
block storage, such as an AWS EBS volume to perform the operation, with the
following impact:

* Users need to configure the maximum IOPS and throughput setting values for the
  volume.
* The required import time is likely to be 5-10x longer.

### Prepare the import[​](#prepare-the-import "Direct link to Prepare the import")

Preparation is key. Import is a multi-step process, which consists of:

* Export the existing database as CSV files
* Enable and configure `COPY` command to be optimal for the system
* Prepare target schema in QuestDB

#### Export the existing database[​](#export-the-existing-database "Direct link to Export the existing database")

Export data using one CSV file per table. Include a column that can be used as
the designated timestamp. Data in CSV is not expected to be in any particular
order. If it is not possible to export the table as one CSV, export multiple
files and concatenate these files before importing into QuestDB.

##### Concatenate multiple CSV files[​](#concatenate-multiple-csv-files "Direct link to Concatenate multiple CSV files")

The way to concatenate files depends on whether the CSV files have headers.

For CSV files without headers, concatenation is straightforward:

* Linux
* macOS
* Windows PowerShell

```prism-code
ls *.csv | xargs cat > singleFile.csv
```

```prism-code
ls *.csv | xargs cat > singleFile.csv
```

```prism-code
$TextFiles = Get-Item C:\Users\path\to\csv\*.csv  
# The files are moved to the same folder.  
$TextFiles foreach { Add-Content -Value $(Get-Content $_) -Path C:\Users\path\to\csv\singleFile.csv}
```

For CSV files with headers, concatenation can be tricky. You could manually
remove the first line of the files before concatenating, or use some smart
command line to concatenate and remove the headers. A good alternative is using
the open source tool
[csvstack](https://csvkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/scripts/csvstack.html).

This is how you can concatenate multiple CSV files using *csvstack*:

```prism-code
csvstack *.csv > singleFile.csv
```

#### Things to know about `COPY`[​](#things-to-know-about-copy "Direct link to things-to-know-about-copy")

* `COPY` is disabled by default, as a security precaution. Configuration is
  required.
* `COPY` is more efficient when source and target disks are different.
* `COPY` is parallel when target table is partitioned.
* `COPY` is *serial* when target table is non-partitioned. Out-of-order
  timestamps are rejected.
* `COPY` cannot import data into non-empty table.
* `COPY` indexes CSV file; reading indexed CSV file benefits hugely from disk
  IOPS. We recommend using NVME.
* `COPY` imports one file at a time; there is no internal queuing system yet.
* [COPY reference](/docs/query/sql/copy/)

#### Configure `COPY`[​](#configure-copy "Direct link to configure-copy")

* Enable `COPY` and [configure](/docs/configuration/overview/#copy-settings) the `COPY`
  directories to suit your server.
* `cairo.sql.copy.root` must be set for `COPY` to work.

### Create the target table schema[​](#create-the-target-table-schema "Direct link to Create the target table schema")

If you know the target table schema already, you can
[skip this section](#import-csv).

QuestDB can analyze the input file and infer the schema. This happens
automatically when the target table does not exist.

To have QuestDB help with determining file schema, it is best to work with a
sub-set of CSV. A smaller file allows us to iterate faster if iteration is
required.

Let's assume we have the following CSV:

```prism-code
"locationId","timestamp","windDir","windSpeed","windGust","cloudCeiling","skyCover","visMiles","tempF","dewpF","rain1H","rain6H","rain24H","snowDepth"  
1,"2010-07-05T00:23:58.981263Z",3050,442,512,,"OBS",11.774906006761,-5,-31,58.228032196984,70.471606345673,77.938252342637,58  
2,"2017-10-10T10:13:55.246046Z",900,63,428,5487,"BKN",4.958601701089,-19,-7,4.328016420894,36.020659549374,97.821114441800,41  
3,"2010-03-12T11:17:13.727137Z",2880,299,889,371,"BKN",10.342717709226,46,81,9.149518425127,20.229637391479,20.074738007931,80  
4,"2018-08-21T15:42:23.107543Z",930,457,695,4540,"OBS",13.359184086767,90,-47,33.346163208862,37.501996055160,58.316836760009,13  
...
```

1. Extract the first 1000 line to `test_file.csv` (assuming both files are in
   the `cairo.sql.copy.root` directory):

```prism-code
head -1000 weather.csv > test_file.csv
```

2. Use a simple `COPY` command to import `test_file.csv` and define the table
   name:

   ```prism-code
   COPY weather from 'test_file.csv' WITH HEADER true;
   ```

This creates the `weather` table and returns the ID of the background import
process:

| id |
| --- |
| 5179978a6d7a1772 |

3. In the [Web Console](/docs/getting-started/web-console/overview/) right click table and select
   `Copy Schema to Clipboard` - this copies the schema generated by the input
   file analysis.
4. Paste the table schema to the code editor:

   ```prism-code
   CREATE TABLE 'weather' (  
     timestamp TIMESTAMP,  
     windDir INT,  
     windSpeed INT,  
     windGust INT,  
     cloudCeiling INT,  
     skyCover VARCHAR,  
     visMiles DOUBLE,  
     tempF INT,  
     dewpF INT,  
     rain1H DOUBLE,  
     rain6H DOUBLE,  
     rain24H DOUBLE,  
     snowDepth INT  
   );
   ```
5. Identify the correct schema:

   5.1. The generated schema may not be completely correct. Check the log table
   and log file to resolve common errors using the id (see also
   [Track import progress](#track-import-progress) and [FAQ](#faq)):

   ```prism-code
   SELECT * FROM sys.text_import_log WHERE id = '5179978a6d7a1772' ORDER BY ts DESC;
   ```

| ts | id | table | file | phase | status | message | rows\_handled | rows\_imported | errors |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2022-08-08T16:38:06.262706Z | 5179978a6d7a1772 | weather | test\_file.csvtest\_file.csv |  | finished |  | 999 | 999 | 0 |
| 2022-08-08T16:38:06.226162Z | 5179978a6d7a1772 | weather | test\_file.csvtest\_file.csv |  | started |  |  |  | 0 |

Check `rows_handled`, `rows_imported`, and `message` for any errors and amend
the schema as required.

5.2. Drop the table and re-import `test_file.csv` using the updated schema.

6. Repeat the steps to narrow down to a correct schema.

   The process may require either truncating:

   ```prism-code
   TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;
   ```

   or dropping the target table:

   ```prism-code
   DROP TABLE table_name;
   ```
7. Clean up: Once all the errors are resolved, copy the final schema, drop the
   small table.
8. Make sure table is correctly partitioned. The final schema in our example
   should look like this:

   ```prism-code
   CREATE TABLE 'weather' (  
     timestamp TIMESTAMP,  
     windDir INT,  
     windSpeed INT,  
     windGust INT,  
     cloudCeiling INT,  
     skyCover VARCHAR,  
     visMiles DOUBLE,  
     tempF INT,  
     dewpF INT,  
     rain1H DOUBLE,  
     rain6H DOUBLE,  
     rain24H DOUBLE,  
     snowDepth INT  
   ) TIMESTAMP (timestamp) partition by DAY;
   ```
9. Ready for import: Create an empty table using the final schema.

### Import CSV[​](#import-csv "Direct link to Import CSV")

Once an empty table is created in QuestDB using the correct schema, import can
be initiated with:

```prism-code
COPY weather FROM 'weather.csv' WITH HEADER true TIMESTAMP 'timestamp' FORMAT 'yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.SSSUUUZ';
```

It quickly returns id of asynchronous import process running in the background:

| id |
| --- |
| 55020329020b446a |

### Track import progress[​](#track-import-progress "Direct link to Track import progress")

`COPY` returns an id for querying the log table (`sys.text_import_log`), to
monitor the progress of ongoing import:

```prism-code
SELECT * FROM sys.text_import_log WHERE id = '55020329020b446a';
```

| ts | id | table | file | phase | status | message | rows\_handled | rows\_imported | errors |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2022-08-03T14:00:40.907224Z | 55020329020b446a | weather | weather.csv | null | started | null | null | null | 0 |
| 2022-08-03T14:00:40.910709Z | 55020329020b446a | weather | weather.csv | analyze\_file\_structure | started | null | null | null | 0 |
| 2022-08-03T14:00:42.370563Z | 55020329020b446a | weather | weather.csv | analyze\_file\_structure | finished | null | null | null | 0 |
| 2022-08-03T14:00:42.370793Z | 55020329020b446a | weather | weather.csv | boundary\_check | started | null | null | null | 0 |

Looking at the log from the newest to the oldest might be more convenient:

```prism-code
SELECT * FROM sys.text_import_log WHERE id = '55020329020b446a' ORDER BY ts DESC;
```

Once import successfully ends the log table should contain a row with a 'null'
phase and 'finished' status :

| ts | id | table | file | phase | status | message | rows\_handled | rows\_imported | errors |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2022-08-03T14:10:59.198672Z | 55020329020b446a | weather | weather.csv | null | finished |  | 300000000 | 300000000 | 0 |

Import into non-partitioned tables uses single-threaded implementation (serial
import) that reports only start and finish records in the status table. Given an
ordered CSV file `weather1mil.csv`, when importing, the log table shows:

| ts | id | table | file | phase | status | message | rows\_handled | rows\_imported | errors |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2022-08-03T15:00:40.907224Z | 42d31603842f771a | weather | weather1mil.csv | null | started | null | null | null | 0 |
| 2022-08-03T15:01:20.000709Z | 42d31603842f771a | weather | weather1mil.csv | null | finished | null | 999999 | 999999 | 0 |

The log table contains only coarse-grained, top-level data. Import phase run
times vary a lot (e.g. `partition_import` often takes 80% of the whole import
execution time), and therefore
[the server log](/docs/operations/logging-metrics/#logging) provides an
alternative to follow more details of import:

import log

```prism-code

```

If the [`ON ERROR` option](/docs/query/sql/copy/#options) is set to `ABORT`,
import stops on the first error and the error is logged. Otherwise, all errors
are listed in the log.

The reference to the error varies depending on the phase of an import:

* In the indexing phase, if an error occurs, the absolute input file line is
  referenced:

```prism-code
2022-08-08T11:50:24.319675Z E i.q.c.t.CsvFileIndexer could not parse timestamp [line=999986, column=1]
```

* In the data import phase, if an error occurs, the log references the offset as
  related to the start of the file.

```prism-code
2022-08-08T12:19:56.828792Z E i.q.c.t.TextImportTask type syntax [type=INT, offset=5823, column=0, value='CMP2']
```

The errored rows can then be extracted for further investigation.

### FAQ[​](#faq "Direct link to FAQ")

COPY on a table with symbol columns is very slow. How can I speed it up?

QuestDB uses `256` as the default symbol capacity. If the number of distinct
symbol values exceeds this default significantly, the `COPY` performance will
suffer. Make sure that you specify symbol capacities when creating the table
before running the `COPY` command.

Here is an example:

```prism-code
CREATE TABLE table_name (  
  ts TIMESTAMP,  
  sym SYMBOL CAPACITY 100000  
) TIMESTAMP(ts) PARTITION BY DAY;
```

Refer to the [symbol type documentation](/docs/concepts/symbol/)
for more information on configuring the symbol capacity.

What happens in a database crash or OS reboot?

If reboot/power loss happens while partitions are being attached, the table
may be left with incomplete data. Truncate the table before re-importing
with:

```prism-code
TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;
```

If reboot/power loss happens before any partitions being attached, the import
should not be affected.

I'm getting "COPY is disabled ['cairo.sql.copy.root' is not set?]" error message

Please set `cairo.sql.copy.root` setting, restart the instance and try again.

I'm getting "could not create temporary import work directory [path='somepath', errno=-1]" error message

Please make sure that the `cairo.sql.copy.root` and `cairo.sql.copy.work.root`
are valid paths pointing to existing directories.

I'm getting "[2] could not open read-only [file=somepath]" error message

Please check that import file path is valid and accessible to QuestDB instance
users.

If you are running QuestDB using Docker, please check if the directory mounted
for storing source CSV files is identical to the one `cairo.sql.copy.root`
property or `QDB_CAIRO_SQL_COPY_ROOT` environment variable points to.

For example, the following command can start a QuestDB instance:

```prism-code
docker run -p 9000:9000 \  
-v "/tmp/questdb:/var/lib/questdb" \  
-v "/tmp/questdb/my_input_root:/tmp/questdb_import" \  
-e QDB_CAIRO_SQL_COPY_ROOT=/tmp/questdb_wrong \  
questdb/questdb
```

However, running:

```prism-code
COPY weather from 'weather_example.csv' WITH HEADER true;
```

Results in the "[2] could not open read-only
[file=/tmp/questdb\_wrong/weather\_example.csv]" error message.

I'm getting "column count mismatch [textColumnCount=4, tableColumnCount=3, table=someTable]" error message

There are more columns in input file than in the existing target table. Please
remove column(s) from input file or add them to the target table schema.

I'm getting "timestamp column 'ts2' not found in file header" error message

Either input file is missing header or timestamp column name given in `COPY`
command is invalid. Please add file header or fix timestamp option.

I'm getting "column is not a timestamp [no=0, name='ts']" error message

Timestamp column given by the user or (if header is missing) assumed based on
target table schema is of a different type. Please check timestamp column name
in input file header or make sure input file column order matches that of target
table.

I'm getting "target table must be empty [table=t]" error message

`COPY` doesn't yet support importing into partitioned table with existing data.

Please truncate table before re-importing with:

```prism-code
TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;
```

or import into another empty table and then use `INSERT INTO SELECT`:

```prism-code
INSERT INTO table_name batch 100000  
SELECT * FROM other_table;
```

to copy data into original target table.

I'm getting "io\_uring error" error message

It's possible that you've hit a IO\_URING-related kernel error. Please set
`cairo.iouring.enabled` setting to false, restart QuestDB instance, and try
again.

I'm getting "name is reserved" error message

The table you're trying to import into is in a bad state (incomplete metadata).

Please either drop the table with:

```prism-code
DROP TABLE table_name;
```

and recreate the table or change the table name in the `COPY` command.

I'm getting "Unable to process the import request. Another import request may be in progress." error message

Only one import can be running at a time.

Either cancel running import with:

```prism-code
COPY 'paste_import_id_here' CANCEL;
```

or wait until the current import is finished.

Import finished but table is (almost) empty

Please check the latest entries in log table:

```prism-code
SELECT * FROM sys.text_import_log LIMIT -10;
```

If "errors" column is close to number of records in the input file then it may
mean:

* `FORMAT` option of `COPY` command or auto-detected format doesn't match
  timestamp column data in file
* Other column(s) can't be parsed and `ON ERROR SKIP_ROW` option was used
* Input file is unordered and target table has designated timestamp but is not
  partitioned

If none of the above causes the error, please check the log file for messages
like:

```prism-code
2022-08-08T11:50:24.319675Z E i.q.c.t.CsvFileIndexer could not parse timestamp [line=999986, column=1]
```

or

```prism-code
2022-08-08T12:19:56.828792Z E i.q.c.t.TextImportTask type syntax [type=INT, offset=5823, column=0, value='CMP2']
```

that should explain why rows were rejected. Note that in these examples, the
former log message mentions the absolute input file line while the latter is
referencing the offset as related to the start of the file.

Import finished but table column names are `f0`, `f1`, ...

The input file has no header and the target table does not exist, so columns
received synthetic names. You can rename them with `ALTER TABLE`:

```prism-code
ALTER TABLE table_name RENAME COLUMN f0 TO ts;
```

## Import CSV via Rest[​](#import-csv-via-rest "Direct link to Import CSV via Rest")

The REST API provides an `/imp` endpoint exposed on port `9000` by default. This
endpoint allows streaming tabular text data directly into a table, supporting
CSV, TAB and pipe (`|`) delimited inputs with optional headers. Data types and
structures are detected automatically, but additional configurations can be
provided to improve automatic detection.

note

The REST API is better suited when the following conditions are true:

* Regular uploads of small batches of data into the same table.
* The file batches do not contain overlapping periods (they contain distinct
  days/weeks/months). Otherwise, the import performance will be impacted.

For database migrations, or uploading one large CSV file into QuestDB, users may
consider using the `COPY` SQL command. See
[COPY command documentation](/docs/query/sql/copy/) and
[Guide on CSV import](/docs/ingestion/import-csv/#import-csv-via-copy-sql) for more
details.

### Importing compressed files[​](#importing-compressed-files "Direct link to Importing compressed files")

It is possible to upload compressed files directly without decompression:

```prism-code
gzip -cd compressed_data.tsv.gz | curl -v -F data=@- 'http://localhost:9000/imp'
```

The `data=@-` value instructs `curl` to read the file contents from `stdin`.

### Specifying a schema during CSV import[​](#specifying-a-schema-during-csv-import "Direct link to Specifying a schema during CSV import")

A `schema` JSON object can be provided with POST requests to `/imp` while
creating tables via CSV import. This allows for more control over user-defined
patterns for timestamps, or for explicitly setting types during column-creation.
The following example demonstrates basic usage, in this case, that the
`ticker_name` column should be parsed as `SYMBOL` type instead of `VARCHAR`:

```prism-code
curl \  
  -F schema='[{"name":"ticker_name", "type": "SYMBOL"}]' \  
  -F data=@trades.csv 'http://localhost:9000/imp'
```

If a timestamp column (`ts`) in this CSV file has a custom or non-standard
timestamp format, this may be included with the call as follows:

```prism-code
curl \  
  -F schema='[ \  
    {"name":"ts", "type": "TIMESTAMP", "pattern": "yyyy-MM-dd - HH:mm:ss"}, \  
    {"name":"ticker_name", "type": "SYMBOL"} \  
  ]' \  
  -F data=@trades.csv 'http://localhost:9000/imp'
```

For **nanosecond-precision** timestamps such as
`2021-06-22T12:08:41.077338934Z`, a pattern can be provided in the following
way:

```prism-code
curl \  
  -F schema='[ \  
    {"name":"ts", "type": "TIMESTAMP", "pattern": "yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.SSSUUUNNNZ"} \  
  ]' \  
  -F data=@my_file.csv \  
  http://localhost:9000/imp
```

More information on the patterns for timestamps can be found on the
[date and time functions](/docs/query/functions/date-time/#timestamp-format)
page.

note

The `schema` object must precede the `data` object in calls to this REST
endpoint. For example:

```prism-code
# correct order  
curl -F schema='{my_schema_obj}' -F data=@my_file.csv http://localhost:9000/imp  
# incorrect order  
curl -F data=@my_file.csv -F schema='{my_schema_obj}' http://localhost:9000/imp
```

### Text loader configuration[​](#text-loader-configuration "Direct link to Text loader configuration")

QuestDB uses a `text_loader.json` configuration file which can be placed in the
server's `conf` directory. This file does not exist by default, but has the
following implicit settings:

conf/text\_loader.json

```prism-code
{  
  "date": [  
    {  
      "format": "dd/MM/y"  
    },  
    {  
      "format": "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss"  
    },  
    {  
      "format": "yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.SSSz",  
      "locale": "en-US",  
      "utf8": false  
    },  
    {  
      "format": "MM/dd/y"  
    }  
  ],  
  "timestamp": [  
    {  
      "format": "yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.SSSUUUz",  
      "utf8": false  
    }  
  ]

#### Example[​](#example "Direct link to Example")

Given a CSV file which contains timestamps in the format
`yyyy-MM-dd - HH:mm:ss.SSSUUU`, the following text loader configuration will
provide the correct timestamp parsing:

conf/text\_loader.json

```prism-code
{  
  "date": [  
    {  
      "format": "dd/MM/y"  
    },  
    {  
      "format": "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss"  
    },  
    {  
      "format": "yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.SSSz",  
      "locale": "en-US",  
      "utf8": false  
    },  
    {  
      "format": "MM/dd/y"  
    }  
  ],  
  "timestamp": [  
    {  
      "format": "yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.SSSUUUz",  
      "utf8": false  
    },  
    {  
      "format": "yyyy-MM-dd - HH:mm:ss.SSSUUU",  
      "utf8": false  
    }  
  ]  
}
```

The CSV data can then be loaded via POST request, for example, using cURL:

```prism-code
curl -F data=@weather.csv 'http://localhost:9000/imp'
```
