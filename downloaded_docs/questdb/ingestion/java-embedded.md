## Writing data[​](#writing-data "Direct link to Writing data")

This section provides example codes to write data to WAL and non-WAL tables. See
[Write Ahead Log](/docs/concepts/write-ahead-log/) for details about the
differences between WAL and non-WAL tables.

The following writers are available for data ingestion:

* `WalWriter` for WAL tables
* `TableWriter` for non-WAL tables
* `TableWriterAPI` for both WAL and non-WAL tables as it is an interface for
  `WalWriter` and `Table Writer`

### Writing data using `WalWriter`[​](#writing-data-using-walwriter "Direct link to writing-data-using-walwriter")

The `WalWriter` facilitates table writes to WAL tables. To successfully create
an instance of `WalWriter`, the table must already exist.

Example WalWriter

```prism-code
final CairoConfiguration configuration = new DefaultCairoConfiguration("data_dir");  
try (CairoEngine engine = new CairoEngine(configuration)) {  
    final SqlExecutionContext ctx = new SqlExecutionContextImpl(engine, 1)  
            .with(AllowAllSecurityContext.INSTANCE, null);  
    engine.ddl("CREATE TABLE testTable (" +  
            "a int, b byte, c short, d long, e float, g double, h date, " +  
            "i symbol, j string, k boolean, l geohash(8c), ts timestamp" +  
            ") TIMESTAMP(ts) PARTITION BY DAY WAL", ctx);  
  
    // write data into WAL  
    final TableToken tableToken = engine.getTableTokenIfExists("testTable");  
    try (WalWriter writer = engine.getWalWriter(tableToken)) {  
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {  
            TableWriter.Row row = writer.newRow(Os.currentTimeMicros());  
            row.putInt(0, 123);  
            row.putByte(1, (byte) 1111);  
            row.putShort(2, (short) 222);  
            row.putLong(3, 333);  
            row.putFloat(4, 4.44f);  
            row.putDouble(5, 5.55);  
            row.putDate(6, System.currentTimeMillis());  
            row.putSym(7, "xyz");  
            row.putStr(8, "abc");  
            row.putBool(9, true);  
            row.putGeoHash(10, GeoHashes.fromString("u33dr01d", 0, 8));  
            row.append();  
        }  
        writer.commit();  
    }  
  
    // apply WAL to the table  
    try (ApplyWal2TableJob walApplyJob = new ApplyWal2TableJob(engine, 1, 1)) {  
        while (walApplyJob.run(0)) ;  
    }  
}
```

### Writing data using `TableWriter`[​](#writing-data-using-tablewriter "Direct link to writing-data-using-tablewriter")

Non-WAL tables do not allow concurrent writes via multiple interfaces. To
successfully create an instance, the table must:

* Already exist
* Have no other open writers against it as the `TableWriter` constructor will
  attempt to obtain an exclusive cross-process lock on the table.

Example TableWriter

```prism-code
try (CairoEngine engine = new CairoEngine(configuration)) {  
    final SqlExecutionContext ctx = new SqlExecutionContextImpl(engine, 1)  
            .with(AllowAllSecurityContext.INSTANCE, null);  
    engine.ddl("CREATE TABLE testTable (" +  
            "a int, b byte, c short, d long, e float, g double, h date, " +  
            "i symbol, j string, k boolean, l geohash(8c), ts timestamp" +  
            ") TIMESTAMP(ts) PARTITION BY DAY BYPASS WAL", ctx);  
  
    // write data into WAL  
    final TableToken tableToken = engine.getTableTokenIfExists("testTable");  
    try (TableWriter writer = engine.getWriter(tableToken, "test")) {  
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {  
            TableWriter.Row row = writer.newRow(Os.currentTimeMicros());  
            row.putInt(0, 123);  
            row.putByte(1, (byte) 1111);  
            row.putShort(2, (short) 222);  
            row.putLong(3, 333);  
            row.putFloat(4, 4.44f);  
            row.putDouble(5, 5.55);  
            row.putDate(6, System.currentTimeMillis());  
            row.putSym(7, "xyz");  
            row.putStr(8, "abc");  
            row.putBool(9, true);  
            row.putGeoHash(10, GeoHashes.fromString("u33dr01d", 0, 8));  
            row.append();  
        }  
        writer.commit();  
    }  
}
```

### Writing data using `TableWriterAPI`[​](#writing-data-using-tablewriterapi "Direct link to writing-data-using-tablewriterapi")

`TableWriterAPI` allows writing to both WAL and non-WAL tables by returning the
suitable `Writer` based on the table configurations. The table must already
exist:

Example TableWriterAPI

```prism-code
try (CairoEngine engine = new CairoEngine(configuration)) {  
    final SqlExecutionContext ctx = new SqlExecutionContextImpl(engine, 1)  
            .with(AllowAllSecurityContext.INSTANCE, null);  
    engine.ddl("CREATE TABLE testTable (" +  
            "a int, b byte, c short, d long, e float, g double, h date, " +  
            "i symbol, j string, k boolean, l geohash(8c), ts timestamp" +  
            ") TIMESTAMP(ts) PARTITION BY DAY WAL", ctx);  
  
    // write data into WAL  
    final TableToken tableToken = engine.getTableTokenIfExists("testTable");  
    try (TableWriterAPI writer = engine.getTableWriterAPI(tableToken, "test")) {  
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {  
            TableWriter.Row row = writer.newRow(Os.currentTimeMicros());  
            row.putInt(0, 123);  
            row.putByte(1, (byte) 1111);  
            row.putShort(2, (short) 222);  
            row.putLong(3, 333);  
            row.putFloat(4, 4.44f);  
            row.putDouble(5, 5.55);  
            row.putDate(6, System.currentTimeMillis());  
            row.putSym(7, "xyz");  
            row.putStr(8, "abc");  
            row.putBool(9, true);  
            row.putGeoHash(10, GeoHashes.fromString("u33dr01d", 0, 8));  
            row.append();  
        }  
        writer.commit();  
    }  
  
    // apply WAL to the table  
    try (ApplyWal2TableJob walApplyJob = new ApplyWal2TableJob(engine, 1, 1)) {  
        while (walApplyJob.run(0)) ;  
    }  
}
```

### Detailed steps[​](#detailed-steps "Direct link to Detailed steps")

#### Configure Cairo engine[​](#configure-cairo-engine "Direct link to Configure Cairo engine")

`CairoEngine` is the resource manager for the embedded QuestDB. Its main
function is to facilitate concurrent access to pools of `TableReader` and
suitable writer instances.

New CairoEngine instance

```prism-code
final CairoConfiguration configuration = new DefaultCairoConfiguration("data_dir");  
try (CairoEngine engine = new CairoEngine(configuration)) {
```

A typical application will need only one instance of `CairoEngine`. This
instance will start when the application starts and shuts down when the
application closes. You will need to close `CairoEngine` gracefully when the
application stops.

QuestDB provides a default configuration which only requires the data directory
to be specified. For a more advanced usage, the whole `CairoConfiguration`
interface can be overridden.

#### Create an instance of SqlExecutionContext[​](#create-an-instance-of-sqlexecutioncontext "Direct link to Create an instance of SqlExecutionContext")

Execution context is a conduit for passing SQL execution artifacts to the
execution site. This instance is not thread-safe and it must not be shared
between threads.

Example of execution context

```prism-code
final SqlExecutionContext ctx = new SqlExecutionContextImpl(engine, 1)  
    .with(AllowAllSecurityContext.INSTANCE, null);
```

The second argument of the constructor is the number of threads that will be
helping to execute SQL statements. Unless you are building another QuestDB
server, this value should always be 1.

#### SqlCompiler and blank table[​](#sqlcompiler-and-blank-table "Direct link to SqlCompiler and blank table")

Before we start writing data using a writer, the target table has to exist.
There are several ways to create a new table and we recommend using
`CairoEngine`:

Creating new table

```prism-code
// Create a non-WAL table:  
  
engine.ddl("CREATE TABLE abc (" +  
        "a int, b byte, c short, d long, e float, g double, h date, " +  
        "i symbol, j string, k boolean, l geohash(8c), ts timestamp" +  
        ") TIMESTAMP(ts) PARTITION BY DAY BYPASS WAL", ctx);  
  
// Create a WAL table:  
  
engine.ddl("CREATE TABLE abc (" +  
        "a int, b byte, c short, d long, e float, g double, h date, " +  
        "i symbol, j string, k boolean, l geohash(8c), ts timestamp" +  
        ") TIMESTAMP(ts) PARTITION BY DAY WAL", ctx);
```

As you will be able to see below, the table field types and indexes must match
the code that is populating the table.

Another way to create a table is to obtain a `SqlCompiler` from the engine and
use it to run the DDL statement:

Creating new table with a SqlCompiler

```prism-code
try (SqlCompiler compiler = engine.getSqlCompiler()) {  
    engine.ddl(compiler, "CREATE TABLE abc (" +  
            "a int, b byte, c short, d long, e float, g double, h date, " +  
            "i symbol, j string, k boolean, l geohash(8c), ts timestamp" +  
            ") TIMESTAMP(ts) PARTITION BY DAY WAL", ctx, null);  
}
```

This way the obtained `SqlCompiler` can be reused to run other SQL statements.

Note that `CairoEngine` has a number of helper methods for different types of
SQL statements. These are:

* `CairoEngine#ddl()` - meant to execute CREATE TABLE and ALTER statements.
* `CairoEngine#insert()` - meant to execute INSERT statements.
* `CairoEngine#drop()` - meant to execute DROP TABLE statements.
* `CairoEngine#select()` - meant to execute SELECT queries.

#### A new writer instance[​](#a-new-writer-instance "Direct link to A new writer instance")

We use `CairoEngine` to obtain an instance of the writer. This will enable
reusing this writer instance later, when we use the same method of creating
table writer again.

New table writer instance for a non-WAL table

```prism-code
final TableToken tableToken = engine.getTableTokenIfExists("abc");  
try (TableWriter writer = engine.getWriter(tableToken, "test")) {
```

New table writer instance for a WAL table

```prism-code
final TableToken tableToken = engine.getTableTokenIfExists("abc");  
try (WalWriter writer = engine.getWalWriter(tableToken)) {
```

New table writer instance for either a WAL or non-WAL table

```prism-code
final TableToken tableToken = engine.getTableTokenIfExists("abc");  
try (TableWriterAPI writer = engine.getTableWriterAPI(tableToken, "test")) {
```

`TableWriter` - A non-WAL table uses `TableWriter`, which will hold an exclusive
lock on table `abc` until it is closed and `testing` will be used as the lock
reason. This lock is both intra- and inter-process. If you have two Java
applications accessing the same table only one will succeed at one time.

`WalWriter` - A WAL table uses `WalWriter` to enable concurrent data ingestion,
data modification, and schema changes, as the table is not locked.

`TableWriterAPI` - Both WAL and Non-WAL tables can use `TableWriterAPI`. It is
an interface implemented by both writers.

Note the all of the writer classes are not thread-safe, so they should not be
used concurrently.

#### Create a new row[​](#create-a-new-row "Direct link to Create a new row")

Creating new table row with timestamp

```prism-code
TableWriter.Row row = writer.newRow(Os.currentTimeMicros());
```

Although this operation semantically looks like a new object creation, the row
instance is actually being re-used under the hood. A timestamp is necessary to
determine a partition for the new row. Its value has to be either increment or
stay the same as the last row. When the table is not partitioned and does not
have a designated timestamp column, the timestamp value can be omitted.

Creating new table row without timestamp

```prism-code
TableWriter.Row row = writer.newRow();
```

#### Populate columns[​](#populate-columns "Direct link to Populate columns")

There are `put*` methods for every supported data type. Columns are updated by
an index as opposed to by name.

Populating table column

```prism-code
row.putLong(3, 333);
```

Column update order is not important and updates can be sparse. All unset
columns will default to NULL values.

#### Append a row[​](#append-a-row "Direct link to Append a row")

Following method call:

Appending a new row

```prism-code
row.append();
```

Appended rows are not visible to readers until they are committed. An unneeded
row can also be canceled if required.

Cancelling half-populated row

```prism-code
row.cancel();
```

A pending row is automatically cancelled when `writer.newRow()` is called.
Consider the following scenario:

```prism-code
TableWriter.Row row = writer.newRow(Os.currentTimeMicros());  
row.putInt(0, 123);  
row.putByte(1, (byte) 1111);  
row.putShort(2, (short) 222);  
row.putLong(3, 333);  
row = writer.newRow(Os.currentTimeMicros());  
...
```

Second `newRow()` call would cancel all the updates to the row since the last
`append()`.

#### Commit changes[​](#commit-changes "Direct link to Commit changes")

To make changes visible to readers, writer has to commit. `writer.commit` does
this job. Unlike traditional SQL databases, the size of the transaction does not
matter. You can commit anything between 1 and 1 trillion rows. We also spent
considerable effort to ensure `commit()` is lightweight. You can drip one row at
a time in applications that require such behaviour.

Note that WAL writer commits aren't immediately visible to readers. The
committed data becomes visible once it was applied by the `ApplyWal2TableJob`
job.

## Executing queries[​](#executing-queries "Direct link to Executing queries")

We provide a single API for executing all kinds of SQL queries. The example
below focuses on SELECT and how to fetch data from a cursor.

Compiling SQL

```prism-code
final CairoConfiguration configuration = new DefaultCairoConfiguration(temp.getRoot().getAbsolutePath());  
try (CairoEngine engine = new CairoEngine(configuration)) {  
        final SqlExecutionContext ctx = new SqlExecutionContextImpl(engine, 1)  
                .with(AllowAllSecurityContext.INSTANCE, null);  
        try (RecordCursorFactory factory = engine.select("SELECT * FROM abc", ctx)) {  
            try (RecordCursor cursor = factory.getCursor(ctx)) {  
                final Record record = cursor.getRecord();  
                while (cursor.hasNext()) {  
                    // access 'record' instance for field values  
                }  
            }  
        }  
    }  
}
```

### Detailed steps[​](#detailed-steps-1 "Direct link to Detailed steps")

The steps to setup `CairoEngine`, execution context and `SqlCompiler` are the
same as those we explained in the sections. We will skip them here and focus on
fetching data.

Note the all of the classes described below are not thread-safe, so they should
not be used concurrently.

#### RecordCursorFactory[​](#recordcursorfactory "Direct link to RecordCursorFactory")

You can think of `RecordCursorFactory` as a prepared statement. This is the
entity that holds SQL execution plan with all of the execution artefacts.
Factories are designed to be reused and we strongly encourage caching them. You
also need to make sure that you close factories explicitly when you no longer
need them. Failing to do so can cause memory and/or other resources leak.

#### RecordCursor[​](#recordcursor "Direct link to RecordCursor")

This instance allows iterating over the dataset produced by SQL. Cursors are
relatively short-lived and do not imply fetching all the data. Note that you
have to close a cursor as soon as enough data is fetched ; the closing process
can happen at any time.

#### Record[​](#record "Direct link to Record")

This is cursor's data access API. Record instance is obtained from the cursor
outside of the fetch loop.

Example of fetching data from cursor

```prism-code
final Record record = cursor.getRecord();  
while (cursor.hasNext()) {  
    // access 'record' instance for field values  
}
```

Record does not hold the data. Instead, it is an API to pull data when data is
needed. Record instance remains the same while cursor goes over the data, making
caching of records pointless.

## InfluxDB Line Protocol client library[​](#influxdb-line-protocol-client-library "Direct link to InfluxDB Line Protocol client library")

We have [Java Client Library](/docs/ingestion/clients/java/) to allow fast data
ingestion.
