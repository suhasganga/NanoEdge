QuestDB is tested with the following Python clients:

* [asyncpg](#asyncpg)
* [psycopg3](#psycopg3)
* [psycopg2](#psycopg2)

Other Python clients that are compatible with the PostgreSQL wire protocol
should also work with QuestDB, but we do not test them. If you find a client that
does not work, please [open an issue](https://github.com/questdb/questdb/issues/new?template=bug_report.yaml).

### Performance Considerations[​](#performance-considerations "Direct link to Performance Considerations")

QuestDB is a high-performance database. The PGWire protocol has many flavors, and some of them are not optimized for
performance. We found psycopg2 to be the slowest of the three clients. Our recommendation is to use asyncpg or psycopg3
for the best performance when querying data.

tip

For data ingestion, we recommend using QuestDB's first-party clients with the [InfluxDB Line Protocol (ILP)](/docs/ingestion/overview/)
instead of PGWire. PGWire should primarily be used for querying data in QuestDB. QuestDB provides an
official [Python client](/docs/ingestion/clients/python/) for data ingestion using ILP.

## Connection Parameters[​](#connection-parameters "Direct link to Connection Parameters")

All Python PostgreSQL clients need similar connection parameters to connect to QuestDB:

* **host**: The hostname or IP address of the QuestDB server (default: `localhost`)
* **port**: The PostgreSQL wire protocol port (default: `8812`)
* **user**: The username for authentication (default: `admin`)
* **password**: The password for authentication (default: `quest`)
* **database**: The database name (default: `qdb`)

## asyncpg[​](#asyncpg "Direct link to asyncpg")

[asyncpg](https://pypi.org/project/asyncpg/) is an asynchronous PostgreSQL client library designed for high performance.
It uses Python's async/await syntax and is built specifically for asyncio.

### Features[​](#features "Direct link to Features")

* Fast binary protocol implementation
* Native asyncio support
* Efficient prepared statements
* Connection pooling
* Excellent performance for large result sets

### Installation[​](#installation "Direct link to Installation")

```prism-code
pip install asyncpg
```

### Basic Connection[​](#basic-connection "Direct link to Basic Connection")

```prism-code
import asyncio  
import os  
import time  
  
import asyncpg  
  
  
async def connect_to_questdb():  
    conn = await asyncpg.connect(  
        host='127.0.0.1',  
        port=8812,  
        user='admin',  
        password='quest',  
        database='qdb'  
    )  
  
    version = await conn.fetchval("SELECT version()")  
    print(f"Connected to QuestDB version: {version}")  
  
    await conn.close()  
  
# Set the timezone to UTC  
os.environ['TZ'] = 'UTC'  
if hasattr(time, 'tzset'):  
    # tzset is only available on Unix-like systems  
    time.tzset()  
asyncio.run(connect_to_questdb())
```

note

**Note**: The `asyncpg` client uses the system timezone by default. QuestDB always sends timestamp in UTC.
To set the timezone to UTC, you can set the `TZ` environment variable before running your script.
This is important for time-series data to ensure consistent timestamps.

See the [Timestamp Handling](/docs/query/pgwire/overview/#timestamp-handling) chapter for additional context on how
on how QuestDB handles timezones.

### Querying Data[​](#querying-data "Direct link to Querying Data")

asyncpg provides several methods for fetching data:

* `fetch()`: Returns all rows as a list of Record objects
* `fetchval()`: Returns a single value (first column of first row)
* `fetchrow()`: Returns a single row as a Record object
* `cursor()`: Returns an async cursor for streaming results

```prism-code
import asyncio  
import asyncpg  
from datetime import datetime, timedelta  
import os  
import time  
  
  
async def query_with_asyncpg():  
    conn = await asyncpg.connect(  
        host='127.0.0.1',  
        port=8812,  
        user='admin',  
        password='quest',  
        database='qdb'  
    )  
  
    # Fetch multiple rows  
    rows = await conn.fetch("""  
                            SELECT *  
                            FROM trades  
                            WHERE timestamp >= $1  
                            ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 10  
                            """, datetime.now() - timedelta(days=1))  
  
    print(f"Fetched {len(rows)} rows")  
    for row in rows:  
        print(f"Timestamp: {row['timestamp']}, Symbol: {row['symbol']}, Price: {row['price']}")  
  
    # Fetch a single row  
    single_row = await conn.fetchrow("""  
                                     SELECT *  
                                     FROM trades LIMIT -1  
                                     """)  
  
    if single_row:  
        print(f"Latest trade: {single_row['symbol']} at {single_row['price']}")  
  
    # Fetch a single value  
    count = await conn.fetchval("SELECT count(*) FROM trades")  
    print(f"Total trades: {count}")  
  
    await conn.close()  
  
  
# Set the timezone to UTC  
os.environ['TZ'] = 'UTC'  
if hasattr(time, 'tzset'):  
    time.tzset()  
asyncio.run(query_with_asyncpg())
```

### Using Cursors for Large Result Sets[​](#using-cursors-for-large-result-sets "Direct link to Using Cursors for Large Result Sets")

For large result sets, you can use a cursor to fetch results in batches:

```prism-code
import asyncio  
import asyncpg  
import os  
import time  
  
async def stream_with_cursor():  
    conn = await asyncpg.connect(  
        host='127.0.0.1',  
        port=8812,  
        user='admin',  
        password='quest',  
        database='qdb'  
    )  
  
    async with conn.transaction():  
        # Execute a query that might return a large number of rows  
        cursor = await conn.cursor("""  
                                   SELECT *  
                                   FROM trades  
                                   ORDER BY timestamp  
                                   """)  
  
        batch_size = 100  
        total_processed = 0  
  
        while True:  
            batch = await cursor.fetch(batch_size)  
  
            # If no more rows, break the loop  
            if not batch:  
                break  
  
            total_processed += len(batch)  
            print(f"Processed {total_processed} rows so far...")  
  
    await conn.close()  
    print(f"Finished processing {total_processed} total rows")  
  
  
# Set the timezone to UTC  
os.environ['TZ'] = 'UTC'  
if hasattr(time, 'tzset'):  
    time.tzset()  
asyncio.run(stream_with_cursor())
```

### Connection Pooling[​](#connection-pooling "Direct link to Connection Pooling")

For applications that need to execute many queries, you can use connection pooling:

```prism-code
import asyncio  
import asyncpg  
import os  
import time  
  
async def connection_pool_example():  
    pool = await asyncpg.create_pool(  
        host='127.0.0.1',  
        port=8812,  
        user='admin',  
        password='quest',  
        database='qdb',  
        min_size=5,  
        max_size=20  
    )  
  
    async with pool.acquire() as conn:  
        result = await conn.fetch("SELECT * FROM trades LIMIT 10")  
        print(f"Fetched {len(result)} rows")  
  
    await pool.close()  
  
# Set the timezone to UTC  
os.environ['TZ'] = 'UTC'  
if hasattr(time, 'tzset'):  
    time.tzset()  
asyncio.run(connection_pool_example())
```

### Parameterized Queries[​](#parameterized-queries "Direct link to Parameterized Queries")

asyncpg uses numbered parameters (`$1`, `$2`, etc.) for prepared statements:

```prism-code
import asyncio  
import asyncpg  
from datetime import datetime, timedelta  
import os  
import time  
  
async def parameterized_query():  
    conn = await asyncpg.connect(  
        host='127.0.0.1',  
        port=8812,  
        user='admin',  
        password='quest',  
        database='qdb'  
    )  
  
    end_time = datetime.now()  
    start_time = end_time - timedelta(days=7)  
  
    rows = await conn.fetch("""  
        SELECT  
            symbol,  
            avg(price) as avg_price,  
            min(price) as min_price,  
            max(price) as max_price  
        FROM trades  
        WHERE timestamp >= $1 AND timestamp <= $2  
        GROUP BY symbol  
    """, start_time, end_time)  
  
    print(f"Found {len(rows)} symbols")  
    for row in rows:  
        print(f"Symbol: {row['symbol']}, Avg Price: {row['avg_price']:.2f}")  
  
    await conn.close()  
  
# Set the timezone to UTC  
os.environ['TZ'] = 'UTC'  
if hasattr(time, 'tzset'):  
    time.tzset()  
asyncio.run(parameterized_query())
```

### Batch Inserts with `executemany()`[​](#batch-inserts-with-executemany "Direct link to batch-inserts-with-executemany")

While we recommend using the [InfluxDB Line Protocol (ILP)](/docs/ingestion/overview/) for ingestion, you can also use
the `executemany()` method to insert multiple rows in a single query. It is highly efficient for executing the same
parameterized statements multiple times with different sets of data. This method is significantly faster than executing
individual statements in a loop because it reduces network round-trips and allows for potential batching optimizations
by the database. In our testing, we found that `executemany()` can be 10x-100x faster than using a loop with `execute()`.

It's particularly useful for bulk data insertion, such as recording multiple trades as they occur. `INSERT` performance
grows with the batch size, so you should experiment with the batch size to find the optimal value for your use case. We
recommend starting with a batch size of 1,000 and adjusting it based on further testing.

```prism-code
import asyncio  
import os  
import time  
  
import asyncpg  
from datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone  
  
async def execute_many_market_data_example():  
  
    conn = await asyncpg.connect(  
        host='127.0.0.1',  
        port=8812,  
        user='admin',  
        password='quest',  
        database='qdb'  
    )  
  
    await conn.execute("""  
        CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS trades (  
            timestamp TIMESTAMP,  
            symbol SYMBOL,  
            price DOUBLE,  
            volume LONG,  
            exchange SYMBOL  
        ) timestamp(timestamp) PARTITION BY DAY;  
    """)  
  
    base_timestamp = datetime.now()  
  
    trades_data = [  
        ( (base_timestamp + timedelta(microseconds=10)), 'BTC-USD', 68500.50, 0.5, 'Coinbase'),  
        ( (base_timestamp + timedelta(microseconds=20)), 'ETH-USD', 3800.20, 2.1, 'Kraken'),  
        ( (base_timestamp + timedelta(microseconds=30)), 'BTC-USD', 68501.75, 0.25, 'Binance'),  
        ( (base_timestamp + timedelta(microseconds=40)), 'SOL-USD', 170.80, 10.5, 'Coinbase'),  
        ( (base_timestamp + timedelta(microseconds=50)), 'ETH-USD', 3799.90, 1.5, 'Binance'),  
    ]  
  
    await conn.executemany("""  
        INSERT INTO trades (timestamp, symbol, price, volume, exchange)  
        VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5)  
    """, trades_data)  
    print(f"Successfully inserted {len(trades_data)} trade records using executemany.")  
  
# Set the timezone to UTC  
os.environ['TZ'] = 'UTC'  
if hasattr(time, 'tzset'):  
    time.tzset()  
asyncio.run(execute_many_market_data_example())
```

### Inserting Arrays[​](#inserting-arrays "Direct link to Inserting Arrays")

QuestDB, via the PostgreSQL wire protocol, supports [array data types](/docs/query/datatypes/array/), including multidimensional
arrays. asyncpg makes working with these arrays straightforward by automatically converting Python lists (or lists of lists
for multidimensional arrays) into the appropriate PostgreSQL array format and vice-versa when fetching data.

note

Arrays are supported from QuestDB version 9.0.0.

asyncpg & QuestDB Arrays: Manual Setup Needed

Using array types with asyncpg against QuestDB requires manual type registration.

asyncpg's standard type introspection query is not yet supported by QuestDB. Therefore, you must manually register a "codec"
for your array types with the asyncpg connection, as shown in the code example below. This ensures correct array
handling and avoids errors.

This is a temporary workaround until a permanent solution is available in asyncpg or QuestDB.

When you need to insert multiple rows containing array data, such as a series of order book snapshots, `executemany()`
offers a more performant way to do so compared to inserting row by row with execute().

Batch Inserting L3 Order Book Snapshots

```prism-code
import asyncio  
import os  
import time  
  
import asyncpg  
from datetime import datetime, timedelta  
  
  
async def batch_insert_l3_order_book_arrays():

        user='admin',  
        password='quest',  
        database='qdb'  
    )  
  
    # Workaround for asyncpg using introspection to determine array types.  
    # The introspection query uses a construct that is not supported by QuestDB.  
    # This is a temporary workaround before this PR or its equivalent is merged to asyncpg:

### Binary Protocol[​](#binary-protocol "Direct link to Binary Protocol")

asyncpg uses the binary protocol by default, which improves performance by avoiding text encoding/decoding for data
transfer.

### Performance Tips[​](#performance-tips "Direct link to Performance Tips")

* Use connection pooling for multiple queries
* Take advantage of the binary protocol (used by default)
* Use parameterized queries for repeated query patterns
* For large result sets, use cursors to avoid loading all data into memory at once

## psycopg3[​](#psycopg3 "Direct link to psycopg3")

[psycopg3](https://www.psycopg.org/psycopg3/docs/) is the latest major version of the popular psycopg PostgreSQL
adapter. It's a complete rewrite of psycopg2 with support for both synchronous and asynchronous operations.

### Features[​](#features-1 "Direct link to Features")

* Support for both sync and async programming
* Server-side cursors
* Connection pooling
* Type adapters and converters
* Binary protocol support

### Installation[​](#installation-1 "Direct link to Installation")

```prism-code
pip install psycopg[binary]
```

tip

Use `psycopg[binary]` to install the binary version of psycopg3, which is faster and more efficient. In our testing, we
found that the binary version of psycopg3 is significantly faster than the pure-Python version.

We recommend always passing `binary=True` to the `cursor()` method to use the binary protocol for better performance.
This is especially important for large datasets and array types.

### Basic Connection[​](#basic-connection-1 "Direct link to Basic Connection")

```prism-code
import psycopg  
  
conn = psycopg.connect(  
    host='127.0.0.1',  
    port=8812,  
    user='admin',  
    password='quest',  
    dbname='qdb',  
    autocommit=True  # Important for QuestDB  
)  
  
with conn.cursor(binary=True) as cur:  
    cur.execute("SELECT version()")  
    version = cur.fetchone()  
    print(f"Connected to QuestDB version: {version[0]}")  
  
conn.close()
```

### Querying Data[​](#querying-data-1 "Direct link to Querying Data")

psycopg3 provides several methods for fetching data:

* `fetchall()`: Returns all rows as a list of tuples
* `fetchone()`: Returns a single row as a tuple
* `fetchmany(size)`: Returns a specified number of rows

```prism-code
import psycopg  
from datetime import datetime, timedelta  
  
with psycopg.connect(  
        host='127.0.0.1',  
        port=8812,  
        user='admin',  
        password='quest',  
        dbname='qdb',  
        autocommit=True  
) as conn:  
    with conn.cursor(binary=True) as cur:  
        end_time = datetime.now()  
        start_time = end_time - timedelta(days=1)  
  
        cur.execute("""  
                    SELECT *  
                    FROM trades  
                    WHERE timestamp >= %s  
                      AND timestamp <= %s  
                    ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 10  
                    """, (start_time, end_time))  
  
        rows = cur.fetchall()  
        print(f"Fetched {len(rows)} rows")  
  
        for row in rows:  
            print(f"Timestamp: {row[0]}, Symbol: {row[1]}, Price: {row[2]}")
```

### Row Factories[​](#row-factories "Direct link to Row Factories")

psycopg3 allows you to specify how rows are returned using row factories:

```prism-code
import psycopg  
  
with psycopg.connect(  
        host='127.0.0.1',  
        port=8812,  
        user='admin',  
        password='quest',  
        dbname='qdb',  
        autocommit=True  
) as conn:  
    with conn.cursor(row_factory=psycopg.rows.dict_row, binary=True) as cur:  
        cur.execute("SELECT * FROM trades LIMIT 5")  
        rows = cur.fetchall()  
  
        for row in rows:  
            print(f"Symbol: {row['symbol']}, Price: {row['price']}")  
  
    with conn.cursor(row_factory=psycopg.rows.namedtuple_row, binary=True) as cur:  
        cur.execute("SELECT * FROM trades LIMIT 5")  
        rows = cur.fetchall()  
  
        for row in rows:  
            print(f"Symbol: {row.symbol}, Price: {row.price}")
```

### Server-Side Cursors[​](#server-side-cursors "Direct link to Server-Side Cursors")

For large result sets, you can use server-side cursors:

```prism-code
import psycopg  
  
with psycopg.connect(  
        host='127.0.0.1',  
        port=8812,  
        user='admin',  
        password='quest',  
        dbname='qdb',  
        autocommit=True  
) as conn:  
    with conn.cursor(binary=True) as cur:  
        # Execute a query that might return many rows  
        cur.execute("SELECT * FROM trades")  
  
        batch_size = 1000  
        total_processed = 0  
  
        while True:  
            batch = cur.fetchmany(batch_size)  
  
            if not batch:  
                break  
  
            total_processed += len(batch)  
            if total_processed % 10000 == 0:  
                print(f"Processed {total_processed} rows so far...")  
  
        print(f"Finished processing {total_processed} total rows")
```

### Parameterized Queries[​](#parameterized-queries-1 "Direct link to Parameterized Queries")

psycopg3 uses placeholder parameters (`%s`) for prepared statements:

```prism-code
import psycopg  
from datetime import datetime, timedelta  
  
with psycopg.connect(  
        host='127.0.0.1',  
        port=8812,  
        user='admin',  
        password='quest',  
        dbname='qdb',  
        autocommit=True  
) as conn:  
    with conn.cursor(binary=True) as cur:  
        # Define query parameters  
        end_time = datetime.now()  
        start_time = end_time - timedelta(days=7)  
  
        # Execute a parameterized query  
        cur.execute("""  
                    SELECT symbol,  
                           avg(price) as avg_price,  
                           min(price) as min_price,  
                           max(price) as max_price  
                    FROM trades  
                    WHERE timestamp >= %s  
                      AND timestamp <= %s  
                    GROUP BY symbol  
                    """, (start_time, end_time))  
  
        rows = cur.fetchall()  
        for row in rows:  
            print(f"Symbol: {row[0]}, Avg Price: {row[1]:.2f}")
```

### Async Support[​](#async-support "Direct link to Async Support")

psycopg3 supports async operations:

```prism-code
import asyncio  
import psycopg  
  
async def async_psycopg3():  
    async with await psycopg.AsyncConnection.connect(  
        host='127.0.0.1',  
        port=8812,  
        user='admin',  
        password='quest',  
        dbname='qdb',  
        autocommit=True  
    ) as aconn:  
        async with aconn.cursor(binary=True) as acur:  
            await acur.execute("SELECT * FROM trades LIMIT 10")  
  
            rows = await acur.fetchall()  
  
            print(f"Fetched {len(rows)} rows")  
            for row in rows:  
                print(row)  
  
asyncio.run(async_psycopg3())
```

### Inserting Arrays[​](#inserting-arrays-1 "Direct link to Inserting Arrays")

QuestDB, via the PostgreSQL wire protocol, supports [array data types](/docs/query/datatypes/array/), including multidimensional
arrays.

When you need to insert multiple rows containing array data, such as a series of order book snapshots, `executemany()`
offers a more performant way to do so compared to inserting row by row with execute().

tip

For data ingestion, we recommend using QuestDB's first-party clients with the [InfluxDB Line Protocol (ILP)](/docs/ingestion/overview/)
instead of PGWire. PGWire should primarily be used for querying data in QuestDB.

If you cannot use ILP for some reason, you should prefer [asyncpg](#inserting-arrays) over psycopg3 for performance
reasons. We found that asyncpg is significantly faster than psycopg3 when inserting batches of data including arrays.

Batch Inserting L3 Order Book Snapshots

```prism-code
import asyncio  
import os  
import time  
from datetime import datetime, timedelta  
  
import psycopg  
  
async def batch_insert_l3_order_book_arrays():  
    conn_str = "host=127.0.0.1 port=8812 dbname=qdb user=admin password=quest"  
  
    async with await psycopg.AsyncConnection.connect(conn_str) as conn:  
        async with conn.cursor(binary=True) as cur:  
            await cur.execute("""  
                              CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS l3_order_book  
                              (  
                                  bid DOUBLE [][],  
                                  ask DOUBLE [][],  
                                  timestamp TIMESTAMP  
                              ) TIMESTAMP(timestamp) PARTITION BY DAY WAL;  
                              """)  
            print("Table 'l3_order_book' is ready.")  
  
            # Prepare a list of L3 order book snapshots for batch insertion  
            snapshots_to_insert = []  
            base_timestamp = datetime.now()  
  
            # First row  
            bids1 = [[68500.50, 0.5], [68500.00, 1.2], [68499.50, 0.3]]  
            asks1 = [[68501.00, 0.8], [68501.50, 0.4], [68502.00, 1.1]]  
            ts1 = (base_timestamp + timedelta(seconds=1))  
            snapshots_to_insert.append((bids1, asks1, ts1))  
  
            # Second row  
            bids2 = [[68502.10, 0.3], [68501.80, 0.9], [68501.20, 1.5]]  
            asks2 = [[68502.50, 1.1], [68503.00, 0.6], [68503.50, 0.2]]  
            ts2 = (base_timestamp + timedelta(seconds=2))  
            snapshots_to_insert.append((bids2, asks2, ts2))  
  
            # Third row  
            bids3 = [[68490.60, 2.5], [68489.00, 3.2]]  
            asks3 = [[68491.20, 1.8], [68492.80, 0.7]]  
            ts3 = (base_timestamp + timedelta(seconds=3))  
            snapshots_to_insert.append((bids3, asks3, ts3))  
  
            print(f"Prepared {len(snapshots_to_insert)} snapshots for batch insertion.")  
  
            # Insert the snapshots into the database in a single batch  
            await cur.executemany(  
                """  
                INSERT INTO l3_order_book (bid, ask, timestamp)  
                VALUES (%b, %b, %b)  
                """,  
                snapshots_to_insert  
            )  
            print(f"Successfully inserted {cur.rowcount} L3 order book snapshots using executemany().")  
  
  
if __name__ == "__main__":  
    # Set timezone to UTC  
    os.environ['TZ'] = 'UTC'  
    if hasattr(time, 'tzset'):  
        time.tzset()  
  
    asyncio.run(batch_insert_l3_order_book_arrays())
```

The example above uses `%b` as placeholder parameters instead of the usual `%s` placeholder. This is because
`%b` format forces the use of the binary protocol. By default, psycopg3 uses the text encoding for array
parameters. The binary protocol is more efficient for transferring large amounts of data, especially for
arrays. The binary protocol is also the default for asyncpg, which is why we recommend using asyncpg for
data ingestion over PGWire.

### Connection Pooling[​](#connection-pooling-1 "Direct link to Connection Pooling")

psycopg3 provides connection pooling capabilities. This reduces the overhead of establishing new connections
and allows for efficient reuse of existing connections. The feature requires the `psycopg_pool` package.

psycopg\_pool installation

```prism-code
pip install psycopg_pool
```

```prism-code
from psycopg_pool import ConnectionPool  
  
pool = ConnectionPool(  
    min_size=5,  
    max_size=20,  
    kwargs={  
        'host': '127.0.0.1',  
        'port': 8812,  
        'user': 'admin',  
        'password': 'quest',  
        'dbname': 'qdb',  
        'autocommit': True  
    }  
)  
  
with pool.connection() as conn:  
    with conn.cursor(binary=True) as cur:  
        cur.execute("SELECT * FROM trades LIMIT 10")  
        rows = cur.fetchall()  
        print(f"Fetched {len(rows)} rows")  
  
pool.close()
```

### Performance Tips[​](#performance-tips-1 "Direct link to Performance Tips")

* Use row factories to avoid manual tuple-to-dict conversion
* For large result sets, use server-side cursors
* Take advantage of connection pooling for multiple queries
* Use the async API for non-blocking operations

## psycopg2[​](#psycopg2 "Direct link to psycopg2")

[psycopg2](https://www.psycopg.org/docs/) is a mature PostgreSQL adapter for Python. While not as performant as asyncpg
or psycopg3, it's widely used and has excellent compatibility. This driver is recommended as a last resort for QuestDB
if asyncpg or psycopg3 are not working for you.

### Features[​](#features-2 "Direct link to Features")

* Stable and mature API
* Thread safety
* Connection pooling (with external libraries)
* Server-side cursors
* Rich type conversion

### Installation[​](#installation-2 "Direct link to Installation")

```prism-code
pip install psycopg2-binary
```

### Basic Connection[​](#basic-connection-2 "Direct link to Basic Connection")

```prism-code
import psycopg2  
  
conn = psycopg2.connect(  
    host='127.0.0.1',  
    port=8812,  
    user='admin',  
    password='quest',  
    dbname='qdb'  
)  
  
conn.autocommit = True  
  
with conn.cursor() as cur:  
    cur.execute("SELECT version()")  
    version = cur.fetchone()  
    print(f"Connected to QuestDB version: {version[0]}")  
  
conn.close()
```

### Querying Data[​](#querying-data-2 "Direct link to Querying Data")

psycopg2 provides several methods for fetching data:

* `fetchall()`: Returns all rows as a list of tuples
* `fetchone()`: Returns a single row as a tuple
* `fetchmany(size)`: Returns a specified number of rows

```prism-code
import psycopg2  
from datetime import datetime, timedelta  
  
conn = psycopg2.connect(  
    host='127.0.0.1',  
    port=8812,  
    user='admin',  
    password='quest',  
    dbname='qdb'  
)  
conn.autocommit = True  
  
try:  
    with conn.cursor() as cur:  
        cur.execute("SELECT * FROM trades LIMIT 10")  
  
        rows = cur.fetchall()  
        print(f"Fetched {len(rows)} rows")  
  
        for row in rows:  
            print(f"Timestamp: {row[0]}, Symbol: {row[1]}, Price: {row[2]}")  
  
        # Fetch one row at a time  
        cur.execute("SELECT * FROM trades LIMIT 5")  
        print("\nFetching one row at a time:")  
        row = cur.fetchone()  
        while row:  
            print(row)  
            row = cur.fetchone()  
  
        # Fetch many rows at a time  
        cur.execute("SELECT * FROM trades LIMIT 100")  
        print("\nFetching 10 rows at a time:")  
        while True:  
            rows = cur.fetchmany(10)  
            if not rows:  
                break  
            print(f"Batch of {len(rows)} rows")  
finally:  
    conn.close()
```

### Dictionary Cursors[​](#dictionary-cursors "Direct link to Dictionary Cursors")

psycopg2 provides dictionary cursors to access rows by column name:

```prism-code
import psycopg2.extras  
  
conn = psycopg2.connect(  
    host='127.0.0.1',  
    port=8812,  
    user='admin',  
    password='quest',  
    dbname='qdb'  
)  
conn.autocommit = True  
  
try:  
    with conn.cursor(cursor_factory=psycopg2.extras.DictCursor) as cur:  
        cur.execute("SELECT * FROM trades LIMIT 5")  
        rows = cur.fetchall()  
  
        for row in rows:  
            print(f"Symbol: {row['symbol']}, Price: {row['price']}")  
  
    with conn.cursor(cursor_factory=psycopg2.extras.RealDictCursor) as cur:  
        cur.execute("SELECT * FROM trades LIMIT 5")  
        rows = cur.fetchall()  
  
        for row in rows:  
            print(row)  # Prints as a dict  
finally:  
    conn.close()
```

### Server-Side Cursors[​](#server-side-cursors-1 "Direct link to Server-Side Cursors")

For large result sets, you can use server-side cursors:

```prism-code
import psycopg2  
  
conn = psycopg2.connect(  
    host='127.0.0.1',  
    port=8812,  
    user='admin',  
    password='quest',  
    dbname='qdb'  
)  
conn.autocommit = True  
  
try:  
    with conn.cursor() as cur:  
        # Execute a query that might return many rows  
        cur.execute("SELECT * FROM trades")  
  
        batch_size = 1000  
        total_processed = 0  
  
        while True:  
            batch = cur.fetchmany(batch_size)  
  
            # If no more rows, break the loop  
            if not batch:  
                break  
  
            total_processed += len(batch)  
            if total_processed % 10000 == 0:  
                print(f"Processed {total_processed} rows so far...")  
  
        print(f"Finished processing {total_processed} total rows")  
finally:  
    conn.close()
```

### Parameterized Queries[​](#parameterized-queries-2 "Direct link to Parameterized Queries")

psycopg2 uses placeholder parameters (`%s`) for prepared statements:

```prism-code
import psycopg2  
from datetime import datetime, timedelta  
  
conn = psycopg2.connect(  
    host='127.0.0.1',  
    port=8812,  
    user='admin',  
    password='quest',  
    dbname='qdb'  
)  
conn.autocommit = True  
  
try:  
    with conn.cursor() as cur:  
        end_time = datetime.now()  
        start_time = end_time - timedelta(days=7000)  
  
        cur.execute("""  
                    SELECT symbol,  
                           avg(price) as avg_price,  
                           min(price) as min_price,  
                           max(price) as max_price  
                    FROM trades  
                    WHERE timestamp >= %s  
                      AND timestamp <= %s  
                    GROUP BY symbol  
                    """, (start_time, end_time))  
  
        rows = cur.fetchall()  
        for row in rows:  
            print(f"Symbol: {row[0]}, Avg Price: {row[1]:.2f}")  
finally:  
    conn.close()
```

### Connection Pooling with psycopg2-pool[​](#connection-pooling-with-psycopg2-pool "Direct link to Connection Pooling with psycopg2-pool")

For connection pooling with psycopg2, you can use external libraries like psycopg2-pool:

```prism-code
from psycopg2.pool import ThreadedConnectionPool  
  
pool = ThreadedConnectionPool(  
    minconn=5,  
    maxconn=20,  
    host='127.0.0.1',  
    port=8812,  
    user='admin',  
    password='quest',  
    dbname='qdb'  
)  
  
conn = pool.getconn()  
  
try:  
    conn.autocommit = True  
  
    with conn.cursor() as cur:  
        cur.execute("SELECT * FROM trades LIMIT 10")  
        rows = cur.fetchall()  
        print(f"Fetched {len(rows)} rows")  
finally:  
    pool.putconn(conn)  
  
pool.closeall()
```

### Integration with pandas[​](#integration-with-pandas "Direct link to Integration with pandas")

psycopg2 integrates with pandas over SQLAlchemy, allowing you to read data directly into a DataFrame. This feature
requires the `pandas`, `sqlalchemy`, and `questdb-connect` packages.

pandas, sqlalchemy, and questdb-connect installation

```prism-code
pip install pandas sqlalchemy questdb-connect
```

note

This example shows how to use the SQLAlchemy engine with psycopg2 for querying QuestDB into a pandas DataFrame.
For ingestion from Pandas to QuestDB see our [pandas ingestion guide](/docs/integrations/data-processing/pandas/).

```prism-code
import pandas as pd  
from sqlalchemy import create_engine  
  
from datetime import datetime, timedelta  
  
engine = create_engine("questdb://admin:quest@localhost:8812/qdb")  
  
with engine.connect() as conn:  
    end_time = datetime.now()  
    start_time = end_time - timedelta(days=10000)  
  
    query = """  
            SELECT * \  
            FROM trades  
            WHERE timestamp >= %s \  
              AND timestamp <= %s  
            ORDER BY timestamp \  
            """  
  
    # Execute the query directly into a pandas DataFrame  
    df = pd.read_sql(query, conn, params=(start_time, end_time))  
  
    print(f"DataFrame shape: {df.shape}")  
    print(f"DataFrame columns: {df.columns.tolist()}")  
    print(f"Sample data:\n{df.head()}")
```

### Known Limitations of Psycopg2 with QuestDB[​](#known-limitations-of-psycopg2-with-questdb "Direct link to Known Limitations of Psycopg2 with QuestDB")

* psycopg2 is generally slower than asyncpg and psycopg3

### Performance Tips[​](#performance-tips-2 "Direct link to Performance Tips")

* Use dictionary cursors to avoid manual tuple-to-dict conversion
* For large result sets, use server-side cursors
* Consider using a connection pool for multiple queries
* Set autocommit=True to avoid transaction overhead

## Best Practices for All PGWire Clients[​](#best-practices-for-all-pgwire-clients "Direct link to Best Practices for All PGWire Clients")

### Query Optimization[​](#query-optimization "Direct link to Query Optimization")

For optimal query performance with QuestDB:

1. **Filter on the designated timestamp column**: Always include time filters on the designated timestamp column to
   leverage QuestDB's time-series optimizations
2. **Use appropriate time ranges**: Avoid querying unnecessarily large time ranges
3. **Use SAMPLE BY for large datasets**: Downsample data when appropriate

### Common Time Series Queries[​](#common-time-series-queries "Direct link to Common Time Series Queries")

QuestDB provides specialized time-series functions that work with all PGWire clients:

### SAMPLE BY Queries[​](#sample-by-queries "Direct link to SAMPLE BY Queries")

SAMPLE BY is used for time-based downsampling:

Sample By 1 Hour[Demo this query](https://demo.questdb.io/?query=SELECT%20timestamp%2C%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20symbol%2C%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20avg(price)%20as%20avg_price%2C%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20min(price)%20as%20min_price%2C%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20max(price)%20as%20max_price%0AFROM%20trades%0AWHERE%20timestamp%20%3E%3D%20dateadd('d'%2C%20-7%2C%20now())%20SAMPLE%20BY%201h%3B&executeQuery=true)

```prism-code
SELECT timestamp,  
       symbol,  
       avg(price) as avg_price,  
       min(price) as min_price,  
       max(price) as max_price  
FROM trades  
WHERE timestamp >= dateadd('d', -7, now()) SAMPLE BY 1h;
```

### LATEST ON Queries[​](#latest-on-queries "Direct link to LATEST ON Queries")

LATEST ON is an efficient way to get the most recent values:

LATEST Rows Per Symbol[Demo this query](https://demo.questdb.io/?query=SELECT%20*%0AFROM%20trades%0AWHERE%20timestamp%20IN%20today()%0ALATEST%20ON%20timestamp%20PARTITION%20BY%20symbol%3B&executeQuery=true)

```prism-code
SELECT *  
FROM trades  
WHERE timestamp IN today()  
LATEST ON timestamp PARTITION BY symbol;
```

## Highly-Available Reads with QuestDB Enterprise[​](#highly-available-reads-with-questdb-enterprise "Direct link to Highly-Available Reads with QuestDB Enterprise")

QuestDB Enterprise supports running [multiple replicas](https://questdb.com/docs/high-availability/setup/) to serve queries.
Client applications can specify **multiple hosts** in the connection string. This ensures that initial connections
succeed even if a node is down. If the connected node fails later, the application should catch the error, reconnect to
another host, and retry the read.

## PGWire Known Limitations with QuestDB[​](#pgwire-known-limitations-with-questdb "Direct link to PGWire Known Limitations with QuestDB")

* Some PostgreSQL-specific features (complex transaction semantics, exotic data types, certain metadata calls) may not be fully supported.
* Cursors/scrollable result sets and some ORM expectations may behave differently than in PostgreSQL.
* Prefer **querying** via PGWire and **ingestion** via ILP for best throughput.

## Troubleshooting[​](#troubleshooting "Direct link to Troubleshooting")

### Connection issues[​](#connection-issues "Direct link to Connection issues")

1. Verify QuestDB is running and listening on port **8812**.
2. Check credentials and network access.
3. Try a minimal query: `SELECT 1`.
4. Inspect QuestDB server logs for connection or auth errors.

### Query Errors[​](#query-errors "Direct link to Query Errors")

For query-related errors:

1. Verify that the table you're querying exists
2. Check the syntax of your SQL query
3. Ensure that you're using the correct data types for parameters
4. Look for any unsupported PostgreSQL features that might be causing issues

### Timestamp confusion[​](#timestamp-confusion "Direct link to Timestamp confusion")

* Remember: **QuestDB stores and encodes timestamps always as UTC**.

## Conclusion[​](#conclusion "Direct link to Conclusion")

QuestDB's support for the PostgreSQL Wire Protocol allows you to use a variety of Python clients to query your
time-series data:

* **asyncpg**: Best performance, especially for large result sets, uses binary protocol by default
* **psycopg3**: Excellent balance of features and performance, supports both sync and async operations
* **psycopg2**: Mature and stable client with wide compatibility, but slower than asyncpg and psycopg3

For most use cases, we recommend using asyncpg or psycopg3 for better performance. For data ingestion, consider using
QuestDB's first-party clients with the InfluxDB Line Protocol (ILP) for maximum throughput.
