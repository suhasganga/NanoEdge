QuestDB is tested with the following R client:

* [RPostgres](https://rpostgres.r-dbi.org/) with [DBI](https://dbi.r-dbi.org/)

Other R clients that are compatible with the PostgreSQL wire protocol
should also work with QuestDB, but we do not test them. If you find a client that
does not work, please [open an issue](https://github.com/questdb/questdb/issues/new?template=bug_report.yaml).

### Performance Considerations[​](#performance-considerations "Direct link to Performance Considerations")

QuestDB is a high-performance database. The PGWire protocol has many flavors, and some of them are not optimized
for performance. For best performance when querying data from QuestDB with R, we recommend using RPostgres with the DBI
interface.

tip

For data ingestion, we recommend using QuestDB's first-party clients with
the [InfluxDB Line Protocol (ILP)](/docs/ingestion/overview/) instead of PGWire. PGWire should primarily be used for
querying data in QuestDB.

## Introduction to PGWire in QuestDB[​](#introduction-to-pgwire-in-questdb "Direct link to Introduction to PGWire in QuestDB")

QuestDB supports the PostgreSQL Wire Protocol (PGWire) for querying data. This compatibility allows you to use standard
R PostgreSQL clients with QuestDB's high-performance time-series database.

It's important to note that QuestDB's underlying storage model differs from PostgreSQL's, which means some PostgreSQL
features may not be available in QuestDB.

## Connection Parameters[​](#connection-parameters "Direct link to Connection Parameters")

The RPostgres client needs the following connection parameters to connect to QuestDB:

* **host**: The hostname or IP address of the QuestDB server (default: `localhost`)
* **port**: The PostgreSQL wire protocol port (default: `8812`)
* **user**: The username for authentication (default: `admin`)
* **password**: The password for authentication (default: `quest`)
* **dbname**: The database name (default: `qdb`)

## RPostgres with DBI[​](#rpostgres-with-dbi "Direct link to RPostgres with DBI")

[RPostgres](https://rpostgres.r-dbi.org/) is a modern DBI-compliant database backend for R that connects to PostgreSQL.
It uses the DBI interface for a consistent workflow with other database types in R.

### Features[​](#features "Direct link to Features")

* DBI compliance for consistent database programming in R
* Support for parameterized queries

### Installation[​](#installation "Direct link to Installation")

Install the required packages from CRAN:

```prism-code
install.packages(c("RPostgres", "DBI"), repos = "https://cloud.r-project.org")
```

### Basic Connection[​](#basic-connection "Direct link to Basic Connection")

Here's a basic example of connecting to QuestDB using RPostgres:

```prism-code
library(RPostgres)  
library(DBI)  
  
con <- dbConnect(  
  Redshift(),  
  dbname = "qdb",  
  host = "localhost",  
  port = 8812,  
  user = "admin",  
  password = "quest"  
)  
  
if (dbIsValid(con)) {  
  cat("Successfully connected to QuestDB!\n")  
  
  version <- dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT version()")  
  print(version)  
  
  dbDisconnect(con)  
} else {  
  cat("Failed to connect to QuestDB.\n")  
}
```

note

When connecting to QuestDB with RPostgres, use `Redshift()` instead of `Postgres()` as the connection method. QuestDB
implements a subset of the PostgreSQL wire protocol similar to Amazon Redshift. Using the `Redshift()` configuration
instructs RPostgres to avoid PostgreSQL-specific features that QuestDB doesn't support, improving compatibility.

### Querying Data[​](#querying-data "Direct link to Querying Data")

RPostgres with DBI provides several functions for executing queries:

```prism-code
library(RPostgres)  
library(DBI)  
  
# Connect to QuestDB  
con <- dbConnect(  
  Redshift(),  
  dbname = "qdb",  
  host = "localhost",  
  port = 8812,  
  user = "admin",  
  password = "quest"  
)  
  
trades <- dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT * FROM public.trades LIMIT 10")  
print(trades)  
  
# Close the connection  
dbDisconnect(con)
```

### Parameterized Queries[​](#parameterized-queries "Direct link to Parameterized Queries")

Using parameterized queries helps prevent SQL injection and improves code readability:

```prism-code
library(RPostgres)  
library(DBI)  
  
con <- dbConnect(  
  Redshift(),  
  dbname = "qdb",  
  host = "localhost",  
  port = 8812,  
  user = "admin",  
  password = "quest"  
)  
  
symbol <- "BTC-USD"  
limit_rows <- 10  
  
# Method 1: Using parameter substitution (safest approach)  
query <- "SELECT * FROM trades WHERE symbol = $1 ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT $2"  
trades <- dbGetQuery(con, query, params = list(symbol, limit_rows))  
print(trades)  
  
# Method 2: Using glue_sql from glue package (if installed)  
if (requireNamespace("glue", quietly = TRUE)) {  
  library(glue)  
  query <- glue_sql("SELECT * FROM trades WHERE symbol = {symbol} ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT {as.integer(limit_rows)}",  
                    .con = con)  
  trades2 <- dbGetQuery(con, query)  
  print(trades2)  
}  
  
# Close the connection  
dbDisconnect(con)
```

### Handling QuestDB-Specific Time-Series Queries[​](#handling-questdb-specific-time-series-queries "Direct link to Handling QuestDB-Specific Time-Series Queries")

QuestDB provides specialized time-series functions that can be used with RPostgres:

```prism-code
library(RPostgres)  
library(DBI)  
  
# Connect to QuestDB  
con <- dbConnect(  
  Redshift(),  
  dbname = "qdb",  
  host = "localhost",  
  port = 8812,  
  user = "admin",  
  password = "quest"  
)  
  
# SAMPLE BY query (time-based downsampling)  
cat("Executing SAMPLE BY query...\n")  
sampled_data <- dbGetQuery(con, "  
  SELECT  
    timestamp,  
    symbol,  
    avg(price) as avg_price,  
    min(price) as min_price,  
    max(price) as max_price  
  FROM trades  
  WHERE timestamp >= dateadd('d', -7000, now())  
  SAMPLE BY 1h  
")  
print(head(sampled_data))  
  
# LATEST ON query (last value per group)  
cat("\nExecuting LATEST ON query...\n")  
latest_data <- dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT * FROM trades LATEST ON timestamp PARTITION BY symbol")  
print(latest_data)  
  
# Close the connection  
dbDisconnect(con)
```

### Integration with Popular R Packages[​](#integration-with-popular-r-packages "Direct link to Integration with Popular R Packages")

Here's how to integrate QuestDB with popular R analysis packages:

```prism-code
library(RPostgres)  
library(DBI)  
library(dplyr)  
library(ggplot2)  
  
# Connect to QuestDB  
con <- dbConnect(  
  Redshift(),  
  dbname = "qdb",  
  host = "localhost",  
  port = 8812,  
  user = "admin",  
  password = "quest"  
)  
  
# Fetch hourly sampled price data  
hourly_prices <- dbGetQuery(con, "  
  SELECT  
    timestamp,  
    symbol,  
    avg(price) as avg_price  
  FROM trades  
  WHERE timestamp >= dateadd('d', -30, now())  
    AND symbol IN ('BTC-USD', 'ETH-USD')  
  SAMPLE BY 1h  
")  
  
# Process data with dplyr  
processed_data <- hourly_prices %>%  
  mutate(  
    date = as_date(timestamp),  
    hour = hour(timestamp)  
  ) %>%  
  group_by(symbol, date) %>%  
  summarize(  
    daily_avg = mean(avg_price),  
    daily_min = min(avg_price),  
    daily_max = max(avg_price),  
    volatility = daily_max - daily_min,  
    .groups = 'drop'  
  )  
  
print(head(processed_data))  
  
# Create a plot with ggplot2  
p <- ggplot(hourly_prices, aes(x = timestamp, y = avg_price, color = symbol)) +  
  geom_line() +  
  labs(  
    title = "Cryptocurrency Prices - 30 Day History",  
    x = "Date",  
    y = "Price (USD)",  
    color = "Symbol"  
  ) +  
  theme_minimal()  
  
print(p)  
  
# Close the connection  
dbDisconnect(con)
```

### Known Limitations with QuestDB[​](#known-limitations-with-questdb "Direct link to Known Limitations with QuestDB")

When using RPostgres with QuestDB, be aware of these limitations:

1. **Transaction Semantics**: QuestDB has different transaction semantics compared to traditional RDBMS.
2. **Schema Management**: QuestDB's table creation and schema modification capabilities differ from PostgreSQL.
3. **R-Specific Data Types**: Some R data types might not map directly to QuestDB types.
4. **Time Zone Handling**: Be careful with time zone conversions, as R and QuestDB might handle them differently.

### Performance Tips[​](#performance-tips "Direct link to Performance Tips")

1. **Use RPostgres**: RPostgres is generally faster than older R PostgreSQL drivers.
2. **Limit Result Sets**: When working with large datasets, use LIMIT clauses to avoid memory issues in R.
3. **Parameterized Queries**: Use parameterized queries for better security and performance.
4. **Optimize Queries**: Take advantage of QuestDB's time-series functions like `SAMPLE BY` and `LATEST ON` for
   efficient queries.
5. **Pre-filter Data**: Perform filtering in SQL rather than in R when possible.

## QuestDB Time Series Features[​](#questdb-time-series-features "Direct link to QuestDB Time Series Features")

QuestDB provides specialized time-series functions that can be used with RPostgres:

### SAMPLE BY Queries[​](#sample-by-queries "Direct link to SAMPLE BY Queries")

SAMPLE BY is used for time-based downsampling:

Sample By 1 Hour[Demo this query](https://demo.questdb.io/?query=SELECT%20timestamp%2C%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20symbol%2C%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20avg(price)%20as%20avg_price%2C%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20min(price)%20as%20min_price%2C%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20max(price)%20as%20max_price%0AFROM%20trades%0AWHERE%20timestamp%20%3E%3D%20dateadd('d'%2C%20-7%2C%20now())%20SAMPLE%20BY%201h%3B&executeQuery=true)

```prism-code
SELECT timestamp,  
       symbol,  
       avg(price) as avg_price,  
       min(price) as min_price,  
       max(price) as max_price  
FROM trades  
WHERE timestamp >= dateadd('d', -7, now()) SAMPLE BY 1h;
```

### LATEST ON Queries[​](#latest-on-queries "Direct link to LATEST ON Queries")

LATEST ON is an efficient way to get the most recent values:

LATEST Rows Per Symbol[Demo this query](https://demo.questdb.io/?query=SELECT%20*%0AFROM%20trades%0AWHERE%20timestamp%20IN%20today()%0ALATEST%20ON%20timestamp%20PARTITION%20BY%20symbol%3B&executeQuery=true)

```prism-code
SELECT *  
FROM trades  
WHERE timestamp IN today()  
LATEST ON timestamp PARTITION BY symbol;
```

## Highly-Available Reads with QuestDB Enterprise[​](#highly-available-reads-with-questdb-enterprise "Direct link to Highly-Available Reads with QuestDB Enterprise")

QuestDB Enterprise supports running [multiple replicas](https://questdb.com/docs/high-availability/setup/) to serve queries.
Client applications can specify **multiple hosts** in the connection string. This ensures that initial connections
succeed even if a node is down. If the connected node fails later, the application should catch the error, reconnect to
another host, and retry the read.

See our blog post for background and the companion repository for a minimal example:

* Blog: [Highly-available reads with QuestDB](https://questdb.com/blog/highly-available-reads-with-questdb/)
* Example: [questdb/questdb-ha-reads](https://github.com/questdb/questdb-ha-reads)

## PGWire Known Limitations with QuestDB[​](#pgwire-known-limitations-with-questdb "Direct link to PGWire Known Limitations with QuestDB")

* Some PostgreSQL-specific features (complex transaction semantics, exotic data types, certain metadata calls) may not be fully supported.
* Cursors/scrollable result sets and some ORM expectations may behave differently than in PostgreSQL.
* Prefer **querying** via PGWire and **ingestion** via ILP for best throughput.

## Troubleshooting[​](#troubleshooting "Direct link to Troubleshooting")

### Connection issues[​](#connection-issues "Direct link to Connection issues")

1. Verify QuestDB is running and listening on port **8812**.
2. Check credentials and network access.
3. Try a minimal query: `SELECT 1`.
4. Inspect QuestDB server logs for connection or auth errors.

### Query Errors[​](#query-errors "Direct link to Query Errors")

For query-related errors:

1. Verify that the table you're querying exists
2. Check the syntax of your SQL query
3. Ensure that you're using the correct data types for parameters
4. Look for any unsupported PostgreSQL features that might be causing issues

### Timestamp confusion[​](#timestamp-confusion "Direct link to Timestamp confusion")

* Remember: **QuestDB stores and encodes timestamps always as UTC**.

### Data Type Issues[​](#data-type-issues "Direct link to Data Type Issues")

For data type-related problems:

1. Use `str()` to check the structure of your R data frames.
2. Ensure date and timestamp columns are properly converted using `as.POSIXct()`.
3. For numeric columns, verify that values are not being converted to characters.

## Conclusion[​](#conclusion "Direct link to Conclusion")

RPostgres with DBI provides a robust way to connect R applications to QuestDB through the PostgreSQL Wire Protocol. By
following the guidelines in this documentation, you can effectively query time-series data from QuestDB and integrate it
with R's powerful data analysis and visualization capabilities.

For data ingestion, it's recommended to use QuestDB's first-party clients with the InfluxDB Line Protocol (ILP) for
high-throughput data insertion.

QuestDB's SQL extensions for time-series data, such as `SAMPLE BY` and `LATEST ON`, provide powerful tools for analyzing
time-series data that can be easily accessed through R.
