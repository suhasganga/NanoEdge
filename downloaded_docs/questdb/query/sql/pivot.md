`PIVOT` transforms rows into columns, converting narrow-schema data into wide-schema format.
This is useful for analytics, charting, and transforming time-series sensor data.

## Syntax[​](#syntax "Direct link to Syntax")

```prism-code
( selectQuery | tableName )  
[ WHERE condition ]  
PIVOT (  
    aggregateExpression [ AS alias ] [, aggregateExpression [ AS alias ] ...]  
    FOR pivotExpression IN ( valueList | selectDistinctQuery )  
    [ FOR pivotExpression IN ( valueList | selectDistinctQuery ) ... ]  
    [ GROUP BY column [, column ...] ]  
) [ AS alias ]  
[ ORDER BY column [, column ...] ]  
[ LIMIT n ]
```

Where `valueList` is: `constant [ AS alias ] [, constant [ AS alias ] ...]`

## Components[​](#components "Direct link to Components")

### Source data[​](#source-data "Direct link to Source data")

A `PIVOT` query begins with a result set:

```prism-code
-- From a table name  
trades PIVOT ( ... )  
  
-- From a SELECT  
SELECT * FROM trades PIVOT ( ... )  
  
-- From a subquery  
(SELECT * FROM trades WHERE timestamp > '2024-01-01') PIVOT ( ... )
```

### Aggregate functions[​](#aggregate-functions "Direct link to Aggregate functions")

Define one or more aggregations, separated by commas:

```prism-code
PIVOT (  
    avg(price),                          -- multiple aggregates  
    sum(price * amount) / 2 AS half_value  -- expressions supported  
    FOR ...  
)
```

### FOR ... IN clause[​](#for--in-clause "Direct link to FOR ... IN clause")

Specifies which column values become output columns:

```prism-code
-- Static value list  
FOR symbol IN ('BTC-USD', 'ETH-USD')  
  
-- With aliases for column names  
FOR symbol IN ('BTC-USD' AS bitcoin, 'ETH-USD' AS ethereum)  
  
-- Dynamic from subquery (executed at parse time)  
FOR symbol IN (SELECT DISTINCT symbol FROM trades)  
  
-- Multiple FOR clauses create Cartesian product  
FOR symbol IN ('BTC-USD', 'ETH-USD')  
    side IN ('buy', 'sell')  
-- Produces: BTC-USD_buy, BTC-USD_sell, ETH-USD_buy, ETH-USD_sell
```

### GROUP BY (optional, inside PIVOT)[​](#group-by-optional-inside-pivot "Direct link to GROUP BY (optional, inside PIVOT)")

Groups results by additional columns:

```prism-code
PIVOT (  
    sum(price * amount) / 2  
    FOR symbol IN ('BTC-USD', 'ETH-USD')  
    GROUP BY side    -- inside PIVOT parentheses  
)
```

note

Positional `GROUP BY` (e.g., `GROUP BY 1, 2`) is not supported inside PIVOT.
Use explicit column names instead.

### ORDER BY / LIMIT (outside PIVOT)[​](#order-by--limit-outside-pivot "Direct link to ORDER BY / LIMIT (outside PIVOT)")

Sort and limit the final result set:

```prism-code
trades PIVOT (  
    avg(price)  
    FOR symbol IN ('BTC-USD', 'ETH-USD')  
    GROUP BY side  
)  
ORDER BY side      -- outside PIVOT parentheses  
LIMIT 10
```

## Examples[​](#examples "Direct link to Examples")

### Basic pivot[​](#basic-pivot "Direct link to Basic pivot")

Transform rows to columns:

Row-based query

```prism-code
SELECT symbol, avg(price)  
FROM trades  
GROUP BY symbol;
```

| symbol | avg |
| --- | --- |
| BTC-USD | 39267.64 |
| ETH-USD | 2615.42 |

Without `PIVOT`, converting rows to columns requires verbose `CASE` expressions:

Manual pivot with CASE

```prism-code
SELECT  
    avg(CASE WHEN symbol = 'BTC-USD' THEN price END) AS "BTC-USD",  
    avg(CASE WHEN symbol = 'ETH-USD' THEN price END) AS "ETH-USD"  
FROM trades;
```

`PIVOT` simplifies this pattern:

Pivoted to columns

```prism-code
trades PIVOT (  
    avg(price)  
    FOR symbol IN ('BTC-USD', 'ETH-USD')  
);
```

| BTC-USD | ETH-USD |
| --- | --- |
| 39267.64 | 2615.42 |

### Multiple aggregates[​](#multiple-aggregates "Direct link to Multiple aggregates")

```prism-code
trades PIVOT (  
    avg(price) AS avg_price,  
    sum(price * amount) / 2 AS half_value  
    FOR symbol IN ('BTC-USD', 'ETH-USD')  
);
```

| BTC-USD\_avg\_price | BTC-USD\_half\_value | ETH-USD\_avg\_price | ETH-USD\_half\_value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 39267.64 | 24500.12 | 2615.42 | 588.25 |

### Multiple FOR clauses (Cartesian product)[​](#multiple-for-clauses-cartesian-product "Direct link to Multiple FOR clauses (Cartesian product)")

```prism-code
trades PIVOT (  
    avg(price)  
    FOR symbol IN ('BTC-USD', 'ETH-USD')  
        side IN ('buy', 'sell')  
);
```

| BTC-USD\_buy | BTC-USD\_sell | ETH-USD\_buy | ETH-USD\_sell |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 39300.00 | 39267.64 | 2620.00 | 2615.54 |

### With GROUP BY[​](#with-group-by "Direct link to With GROUP BY")

Keep additional dimensions as rows:

```prism-code
trades PIVOT (  
    avg(price)  
    FOR symbol IN ('BTC-USD', 'ETH-USD')  
    GROUP BY side  
) ORDER BY side;
```

| side | BTC-USD | ETH-USD |
| --- | --- | --- |
| buy | 39300.00 | 2620.00 |
| sell | 39267.64 | 2615.54 |

note

When a GROUP BY key has no matching FOR values in the data, the entire row is
excluded from results rather than appearing with NULL pivot columns. This is
due to filter optimization that pushes `FOR column IN (values)` to the WHERE clause.

For example, if `side = 'hold'` exists but has no matching symbols, that row won't appear.

### Dynamic IN list from subquery[​](#dynamic-in-list-from-subquery "Direct link to Dynamic IN list from subquery")

Column names determined at query compile time:

```prism-code
trades PIVOT (  
    avg(price)  
    FOR symbol IN (SELECT DISTINCT symbol FROM trades ORDER BY symbol)  
    GROUP BY side  
);
```

warning

Subqueries in the `IN` clause are executed at parse time, not at runtime.
Changes to the source table after query compilation won't affect column names.

note

Subqueries in the `IN` clause must:

* Return exactly one column
* Return at least one row (empty result sets cause an error)

tip

If the subquery runs on a large table, it can slow down the overall `PIVOT` query.
For exploratory analysis, dynamic subqueries are convenient. For production queries,
use a constant list or store keys in a small dimension table for better performance.

### With CTEs[​](#with-ctes "Direct link to With CTEs")

```prism-code
WITH recent_trades AS (  
    SELECT * FROM trades  
    WHERE timestamp > dateadd('d', -1, now())  
)  
SELECT * FROM recent_trades  
PIVOT (  
    avg(price)  
    FOR symbol IN (SELECT DISTINCT symbol FROM recent_trades)  
    GROUP BY side  
);
```

## Column naming[​](#column-naming "Direct link to Column naming")

Output columns are automatically named based on the combination of FOR values and aggregates.

With a **single aggregate**, columns are named using just the FOR value:

```prism-code
trades PIVOT (  
    avg(price)  
    FOR symbol IN ('BTC-USD', 'ETH-USD')  
);  
-- Columns: BTC-USD, ETH-USD
```

With **multiple aggregates**, the full function expression is included:

```prism-code
trades PIVOT (  
    avg(price), sum(price)  
    FOR symbol IN ('BTC-USD', 'ETH-USD')  
);  
-- Columns: BTC-USD_avg(price), BTC-USD_sum(price), ETH-USD_avg(price), ETH-USD_sum(price)
```

Use **aliases** for cleaner column names:

```prism-code
trades PIVOT (  
    avg(price) AS avg_price, sum(price) AS total_price  
    FOR symbol IN ('BTC-USD', 'ETH-USD')  
);  
-- Columns: BTC-USD_avg_price, BTC-USD_total_price, ETH-USD_avg_price, ETH-USD_total_price
```

| Scenario | Example | Column name |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Single aggregate | `avg(price) FOR symbol IN ('BTC')` | `BTC` |
| Multiple aggregates | `avg(price), sum(price) FOR symbol IN ('BTC')` | `BTC_avg(price)`, `BTC_sum(price)` |
| Multiple FOR | `avg(price) FOR symbol IN ('BTC') side IN ('buy')` | `BTC_buy` |
| With alias on value | `FOR symbol IN ('BTC-USD' AS btc)` | `btc` |
| With alias on aggregate | `avg(price) AS avg_price FOR symbol IN ('BTC')` | `BTC_avg_price` |

## Limits[​](#limits "Direct link to Limits")

PIVOT has a configurable maximum column limit (default: 5000) to prevent excessive memory usage.
The total columns = `(FOR value combinations) × (number of aggregates)`.

```prism-code
-- This would fail if combinations × aggregates > 5000  
trades PIVOT (  
    avg(price)  
    FOR symbol IN (SELECT DISTINCT symbol FROM trades)  -- many symbols  
        side IN ('buy', 'sell')                         -- × 2  
);
```
