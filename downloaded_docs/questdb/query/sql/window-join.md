WINDOW JOIN is a SQL join type that efficiently aggregates data from a related
table within a time-based window around each row. It is particularly useful for
financial time-series analysis, such as calculating rolling statistics from
price feeds, computing moving averages, or aggregating sensor readings within
time windows.

It is a variant of the [`JOIN` keyword](/docs/query/sql/join/) and shares
many of its execution traits.

WINDOW JOIN vs Window Functions

Despite the similar name, WINDOW JOIN and [window functions](/docs/query/functions/window-functions/overview/) serve different purposes:

* **WINDOW JOIN**: Aggregates data from a *different table* within a time window around each row. Uses `RANGE BETWEEN` to define a time-based window relative to each row's timestamp.
* **Window functions**: Perform calculations across rows *within the same table* using the `OVER` clause with `PARTITION BY`, `ORDER BY`, and frame specifications.

Use WINDOW JOIN when you need to correlate and aggregate data across two time-series tables. Use window functions for calculations within a single table.

## Syntax[​](#syntax "Direct link to Syntax")

```prism-code
SELECT  
    left_columns,  
    aggregate_function(right_column) AS result  
FROM left_table [alias]  
WINDOW JOIN right_table [alias]  
    [ON join_condition]  
    RANGE BETWEEN <lo_bound> AND <hi_bound>  
    [INCLUDE PREVAILING | EXCLUDE PREVAILING]  
[WHERE filter_on_left]  
[ORDER BY ...]
```

### RANGE clause[​](#range-clause "Direct link to RANGE clause")

The `RANGE` clause defines the time window relative to each left row's
timestamp. Both boundaries are inclusive.

```prism-code
RANGE BETWEEN <value> <unit> PRECEDING AND <value> <unit> FOLLOWING  
RANGE BETWEEN <value> <unit> PRECEDING AND <value> <unit> PRECEDING  -- past window  
RANGE BETWEEN <value> <unit> FOLLOWING AND <value> <unit> FOLLOWING  -- future window
```

Supported time units:

* `nanoseconds`
* `microseconds`
* `milliseconds`
* `seconds`
* `minutes`
* `hours`
* `days`

note

`UNBOUNDED PRECEDING` and `UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING` are not supported in WINDOW
JOIN.

### INCLUDE/EXCLUDE PREVAILING[​](#includeexclude-prevailing "Direct link to INCLUDE/EXCLUDE PREVAILING")

* `INCLUDE PREVAILING` (default): Includes right table rows within the time window
  plus the most recent right row with a timestamp equal to or earlier than the
  window start (similar to [ASOF JOIN](/docs/query/sql/asof-join/) behavior),
  useful for "last known value" scenarios
* `EXCLUDE PREVAILING`: Only includes right table rows strictly within the time window

## Requirements[​](#requirements "Direct link to Requirements")

1. Both tables must have [designated timestamps](/docs/concepts/designated-timestamp/)
   and be partitioned
2. The right table must be a direct table reference, not a subquery
3. Aggregate functions are required - you cannot select non-aggregated columns
   from the right table
4. Symbol-based join conditions enable "Fast Join" optimization when matching on
   symbol columns

## Aggregate functions[​](#aggregate-functions "Direct link to Aggregate functions")

WINDOW JOIN supports all aggregate functions on the right table. However, the
following functions use SIMD-optimized aggregation and will run faster:

* `sum()` - Sum of values
* `avg()` - Average/mean
* `count()` - Count of matching rows
* `min()` / `max()` - Minimum/maximum values
* `first()` / `last()` - First/last value in the window
* `first_not_null()` / `last_not_null()` - First/last non-null value

When only these optimized functions are used, queries benefit from vectorized
execution.

## Examples[​](#examples "Direct link to Examples")

For the following examples, consider two tables:

* `trades`: A table of executed trades with `sym`, `price`, and `ts` columns
* `prices`: A table of price quotes with `sym`, `price`, `bid`, and `ts` columns

### Basic example: Rolling sum[​](#basic-example-rolling-sum "Direct link to Basic example: Rolling sum")

Calculate the sum of prices from the `prices` table within ±1 minute of each
trade:

Rolling sum within a time window

```prism-code
SELECT  
    t.sym,  
    t.price,  
    t.ts,  
    sum(p.price) AS window_sum  
FROM trades t  
WINDOW JOIN prices p  
    ON (t.sym = p.sym)  
    RANGE BETWEEN 1 minute PRECEDING AND 1 minute FOLLOWING  
    EXCLUDE PREVAILING  
ORDER BY t.ts;
```

### Symbol-based Fast Join[​](#symbol-based-fast-join "Direct link to Symbol-based Fast Join")

When joining on symbol columns, QuestDB uses an optimized "Fast Join" path for
improved performance:

Fast Join with symbol matching

```prism-code
SELECT  
    t.sym,  
    t.ts,  
    avg(p.bid) AS avg_bid,  
    count() AS num_prices  
FROM trades t  
WINDOW JOIN prices p  
    ON (t.sym = p.sym)  
    RANGE BETWEEN 5 seconds PRECEDING AND 5 seconds FOLLOWING  
    EXCLUDE PREVAILING;
```

### With additional join filters[​](#with-additional-join-filters "Direct link to With additional join filters")

You can add additional conditions to the `ON` clause to filter the right table:

WINDOW JOIN with price filter

```prism-code
SELECT  
    t.sym,  
    t.ts,  
    avg(p.price) AS avg_price  
FROM trades t  
WINDOW JOIN prices p  
    ON (t.sym = p.sym) AND p.price < 300  
    RANGE BETWEEN 2 minutes PRECEDING AND 2 minutes FOLLOWING  
    EXCLUDE PREVAILING  
ORDER BY t.ts;
```

### Past-only window[​](#past-only-window "Direct link to Past-only window")

Look back at a historical window before each trade:

Historical window (2 to 1 minutes before)

```prism-code
SELECT  
    t.sym,  
    t.ts,  
    sum(p.price) AS past_sum  
FROM trades t  
WINDOW JOIN prices p  
    ON (t.sym = p.sym)  
    RANGE BETWEEN 2 minutes PRECEDING AND 1 minute PRECEDING  
    EXCLUDE PREVAILING;
```

### Future-only window[​](#future-only-window "Direct link to Future-only window")

Look ahead at a future window after each trade:

Future window (1 to 2 minutes after)

```prism-code
SELECT  
    t.sym,  
    t.ts,  
    sum(p.price) AS future_sum  
FROM trades t  
WINDOW JOIN prices p  
    ON (t.sym = p.sym)  
    RANGE BETWEEN 1 minute FOLLOWING AND 2 minutes FOLLOWING  
    EXCLUDE PREVAILING;
```

### Cross-table aggregation (no symbol match)[​](#cross-table-aggregation-no-symbol-match "Direct link to Cross-table aggregation (no symbol match)")

Aggregate all prices within the time window regardless of symbol:

Aggregate all prices in window

```prism-code
SELECT  
    t.sym,  
    t.ts,  
    count() AS total_prices  
FROM trades t  
WINDOW JOIN prices p  
    RANGE BETWEEN 1 minute PRECEDING AND 1 minute FOLLOWING  
    EXCLUDE PREVAILING;
```

### Chained WINDOW JOINs[​](#chained-window-joins "Direct link to Chained WINDOW JOINs")

You can chain multiple WINDOW JOINs together to aggregate from different tables
or with different time windows:

Chained WINDOW JOINs

```prism-code
SELECT  
    t.sym,  
    t.ts,  
    t.price,  
    sum(p.bid) AS sum_bids,  
    avg(q.ask) AS avg_asks  
FROM trades t  
WINDOW JOIN bids p  
    ON (t.sym = p.sym)  
    RANGE BETWEEN 1 minute PRECEDING AND 1 minute FOLLOWING  
WINDOW JOIN asks q  
    ON (t.sym = q.sym)  
    RANGE BETWEEN 30 seconds PRECEDING AND 30 seconds FOLLOWING;
```

Each WINDOW JOIN operates independently, allowing you to aggregate data from
multiple related tables with different time windows in a single query.

### Using EXCLUDE PREVAILING[​](#using-exclude-prevailing "Direct link to Using EXCLUDE PREVAILING")

Exclude the prevailing value to only aggregate rows strictly within the time
window:

WINDOW JOIN excluding prevailing value

```prism-code
SELECT  
    t.sym,  
    t.ts,  
    sum(p.price) AS window_sum  
FROM trades t  
WINDOW JOIN prices p  
    ON (t.sym = p.sym)  
    RANGE BETWEEN 1 minute PRECEDING AND 1 minute FOLLOWING  
    EXCLUDE PREVAILING;
```

This is useful when you want strict window boundaries and do not need the last
known value before the window starts.

### With left table filter[​](#with-left-table-filter "Direct link to With left table filter")

Filter left table rows using a `WHERE` clause:

WINDOW JOIN with WHERE filter

```prism-code
SELECT  
    t.sym,  
    t.ts,  
    sum(p.price) AS window_sum  
FROM trades t  
WINDOW JOIN prices p  
    ON (t.sym = p.sym)  
    RANGE BETWEEN 1 minute PRECEDING AND 1 minute FOLLOWING  
    EXCLUDE PREVAILING  
WHERE t.price < 450  
ORDER BY t.ts;
```

## Query plan analysis[​](#query-plan-analysis "Direct link to Query plan analysis")

Use `EXPLAIN` to see the execution plan and verify optimization:

Analyze WINDOW JOIN execution plan

```prism-code
EXPLAIN SELECT t.sym, sum(p.price)  
FROM trades t  
WINDOW JOIN prices p ON (t.sym = p.sym)  
RANGE BETWEEN 1 minute PRECEDING AND 1 minute FOLLOWING  
EXCLUDE PREVAILING;
```

Look for these indicators in the plan:

* **Async Window Fast Join**: Optimized parallel execution with symbol-based
  join
* **Async Window Join**: Standard parallel execution
* **vectorized: true**: Indicates SIMD-optimized aggregation

## Limitations[​](#limitations "Direct link to Limitations")

1. `UNBOUNDED PRECEDING` and `UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING` are not supported
2. The right table must be a direct table, not a subquery
3. Cannot reference non-aggregated right table columns in `SELECT`
4. Window high boundary cannot be less than low boundary
5. Aggregate functions cannot reference columns from both tables simultaneously
6. WINDOW JOIN can be combined with another WINDOW JOIN, but not with other JOIN
   types
7. **`GROUP BY` is not supported with WINDOW JOIN** - use a CTE or subquery instead

### GROUP BY workaround[​](#group-by-workaround "Direct link to GROUP BY workaround")

WINDOW JOIN cannot be combined with `GROUP BY` in the same query. To aggregate WINDOW JOIN results, wrap the join in a CTE first:

Incorrect - GROUP BY with WINDOW JOIN not supported

```prism-code
-- This will NOT work:  
SELECT  
    t.counterparty,  
    count(*) AS trade_count,  
    avg(first(m.mid_price) - t.price) AS avg_slippage  
FROM trades t  
WINDOW JOIN market_data m ON (t.symbol = m.symbol)  
    RANGE BETWEEN 10 milliseconds FOLLOWING AND 10 milliseconds FOLLOWING  
GROUP BY t.counterparty;  -- ERROR: GROUP BY not supported
```

Correct - use CTE then GROUP BY

```prism-code
WITH trades_with_future_mid AS (  
    SELECT  
        t.counterparty,  
        t.price,  
        first(m.mid_price) AS future_mid  
    FROM trades t  
    WINDOW JOIN market_data m ON (t.symbol = m.symbol)  
        RANGE BETWEEN 10 milliseconds FOLLOWING AND 10 milliseconds FOLLOWING  
        INCLUDE PREVAILING  
    WHERE t.timestamp > dateadd('d', -1, now())  
)  
SELECT  
    counterparty,  
    count(*) AS trade_count,  
    avg(future_mid - price) AS avg_slippage  
FROM trades_with_future_mid  
GROUP BY counterparty;
```

This pattern applies to any aggregation over WINDOW JOIN results - always perform the join first in a CTE, then aggregate in the outer query.

## Performance tips[​](#performance-tips "Direct link to Performance tips")

1. **Use symbol-based joins**: When possible, join on symbol columns to enable
   the Fast Join optimization
2. **Narrow time windows**: Smaller windows mean less data to aggregate
3. **Filter the left table**: Use `WHERE` clauses to reduce the number of rows
   processed
4. **Parallel execution**: WINDOW JOIN automatically leverages parallel
   execution based on your worker configuration
