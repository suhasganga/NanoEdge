Removes a view from the database. The view definition is deleted, but underlying
tables are not affected.

For more information on views, see the [Views](/docs/concepts/views/)
documentation.

## Syntax[​](#syntax "Direct link to Syntax")

```prism-code
DROP VIEW [ IF EXISTS ] view_name
```

## Parameters[​](#parameters "Direct link to Parameters")

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `IF EXISTS` | Prevents error if view doesn't exist |
| `view_name` | Name of the view to drop |

## Examples[​](#examples "Direct link to Examples")

### Drop a view[​](#drop-a-view "Direct link to Drop a view")

Drop view

```prism-code
DROP VIEW my_view
```

### Drop if exists[​](#drop-if-exists "Direct link to Drop if exists")

To avoid errors when the view might not exist:

Drop view if it exists

```prism-code
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS my_view
```

### Drop multiple views[​](#drop-multiple-views "Direct link to Drop multiple views")

Views must be dropped one at a time:

Drop multiple views

```prism-code
DROP VIEW view1;  
DROP VIEW view2;  
DROP VIEW view3;
```

## Behavior[​](#behavior "Direct link to Behavior")

* Dropping a view does not affect the underlying tables
* Dependent views (views that reference the dropped view) become invalid
* The view can be recreated later with the same or different definition

### Effect on dependent views[​](#effect-on-dependent-views "Direct link to Effect on dependent views")

When a view is dropped, any views that reference it become invalid:

Dependent view invalidation

```prism-code
-- Create view hierarchy  
CREATE VIEW level1 AS (SELECT * FROM trades WHERE price > 0);  
CREATE VIEW level2 AS (SELECT * FROM level1 WHERE quantity > 0);  
  
-- Drop base view  
DROP VIEW level1;  
  
-- level2 is now invalid  
SELECT view_status FROM views() WHERE view_name = 'level2';  
-- Returns: invalid
```

If the dropped view is later recreated, dependent views automatically become
valid again.

## Errors[​](#errors "Direct link to Errors")

| Error | Cause |
| --- | --- |
| `view does not exist [view=name]` | View doesn't exist and `IF EXISTS` not specified |
| `Access denied [DROP VIEW on view_name]` | User lacks `DROP VIEW` permission (Enterprise) |

## Permissions (Enterprise)[​](#permissions-enterprise "Direct link to Permissions (Enterprise)")

Dropping a view requires the `DROP VIEW` permission on that view:

```prism-code
-- Grant DROP VIEW permission to a user  
GRANT DROP VIEW ON my_view TO username;  
  
-- Grant DROP VIEW permission on multiple views  
GRANT DROP VIEW ON view1, view2 TO username;
```

When a user creates a view, they are automatically granted all permissions
including `DROP VIEW` on that view.
