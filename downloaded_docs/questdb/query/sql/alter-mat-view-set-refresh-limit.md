Sets a time limit for incremental refresh, preventing old data from overwriting
existing aggregations in a materialized view.

## Syntax[​](#syntax "Direct link to Syntax")

```prism-code
ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW viewName SET REFRESH LIMIT n timeUnit
```

Where `timeUnit` is: `HOURS | DAYS | WEEKS | MONTHS | YEARS` (or shorthand:
`h`, `d`, `w`, `M`, `y`)

## Parameters[​](#parameters "Direct link to Parameters")

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `viewName` | Name of the materialized view to modify |
| `n` | Number of time units |
| `timeUnit` | Time unit for the limit |

## When to use[​](#when-to-use "Direct link to When to use")

Set a refresh limit when:

* You want to protect historical aggregations from late-arriving data
* Base table receives out-of-order inserts with old timestamps
* You need predictable refresh behavior for auditing

## How it works[​](#how-it-works "Direct link to How it works")

When a refresh limit is configured, incremental refresh ignores base table rows
with timestamps older than the limit. This protects already-computed
aggregations from being recalculated.

**Example scenario:**

Set 1-week refresh limit

```prism-code
ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW trades_hourly SET REFRESH LIMIT 1 WEEK;
```

If the current time is `2025-05-02T12:00:00Z` and you insert:

Insert rows with various timestamps

```prism-code
INSERT INTO trades VALUES  
  ('2025-03-02T12:00:00Z', 'BTC-USD', 39269.98, 0.042),  -- 2 months old, ignored  
  ('2025-04-02T12:00:00Z', 'BTC-USD', 39170.01, 0.042),  -- 1 month old, ignored  
  ('2025-05-02T12:00:00Z', 'BTC-USD', 38450.10, 0.042);  -- current, processed
```

Only the third row (within the 1-week limit) triggers an incremental refresh.

note

The limit only applies to incremental refresh. A
[`REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW FULL`](/docs/query/sql/refresh-mat-view/) command
processes all base table rows regardless of the limit.

## Time units[​](#time-units "Direct link to Time units")

| Unit | Singular | Plural | Shorthand |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Hours | `HOUR` | `HOURS` | `h` |
| Days | `DAY` | `DAYS` | `d` |
| Weeks | `WEEK` | `WEEKS` | `w` |
| Months | `MONTH` | `MONTHS` | `M` |
| Years | `YEAR` | `YEARS` | `y` |

**Fixed vs calendar-based:**

* `HOURS`, `DAYS`, `WEEKS`: Fixed durations (1 week = 7 days exactly)
* `MONTHS`, `YEARS`: Calendar-based (1 month from Jan 15 → Feb 15)

## Examples[​](#examples "Direct link to Examples")

Set limit to 1 day

```prism-code
ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW trades_hourly SET REFRESH LIMIT 1 DAY;
```

Set limit to 8 hours (shorthand)

```prism-code
ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW trades_hourly SET REFRESH LIMIT 8h;
```

Set limit to 2 weeks

```prism-code
ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW trades_hourly SET REFRESH LIMIT 2 WEEKS;
```

## Refreshing data outside the limit[​](#refreshing-data-outside-the-limit "Direct link to Refreshing data outside the limit")

To refresh data older than the limit, use
[range refresh](/docs/query/sql/refresh-mat-view/#range):

Refresh a specific time range

```prism-code
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW trades_hourly  
  RANGE FROM '2025-03-01T00:00:00Z' TO '2025-03-02T00:00:00Z';
```

## Permissions (Enterprise)[​](#permissions-enterprise "Direct link to Permissions (Enterprise)")

Changing refresh limit requires the `ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW` permission:

Grant alter permission

```prism-code
GRANT ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW ON trades_hourly TO user1;
```

## Errors[​](#errors "Direct link to Errors")

| Error | Cause |
| --- | --- |
| `materialized view does not exist` | View with specified name doesn't exist |
| `invalid time unit` | Unrecognized time unit |
| `permission denied` | Missing `ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW` permission (Enterprise) |
