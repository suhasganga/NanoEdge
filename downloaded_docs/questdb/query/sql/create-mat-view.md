Creates a materialized view that stores pre-computed query results and refreshes
incrementally as new data arrives. For conceptual overview, see
[Materialized Views](/docs/concepts/materialized-views/).

## Syntax[​](#syntax "Direct link to Syntax")

```prism-code
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW [ IF NOT EXISTS ] viewName  
[ WITH BASE baseTableName ]  
[ REFRESH ( IMMEDIATE | MANUAL | EVERY interval ) [ DEFERRED ]  
           [ START timestamp ] [ TIME ZONE timezone ]  
           [ PERIOD ( LENGTH length [ TIME ZONE tz ] [ DELAY delay ] ) ]  
           [ PERIOD ( SAMPLE BY INTERVAL ) ] ]  
AS [ ( ] query [ ) ]  
[ TIMESTAMP ( columnRef ) ]  
[ PARTITION BY ( YEAR | MONTH | WEEK | DAY | HOUR ) [ TTL n timeUnit ] ]  
[ OWNED BY ownerName ]
```

Where:

* `interval`: Duration like `1m`, `10m`, `1h`, `1d`
* `timeUnit`: `HOURS | DAYS | WEEKS | MONTHS | YEARS`
* `query`: Must contain `SAMPLE BY` or time-based `GROUP BY`

## Parameters[​](#parameters "Direct link to Parameters")

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `viewName` | Name for the materialized view |
| `IF NOT EXISTS` | Create only if view doesn't already exist |
| `WITH BASE` | Specify base table (required for JOINs) |
| `REFRESH` | Refresh strategy (default: `IMMEDIATE`) |
| `DEFERRED` | Skip initial refresh on creation |
| `query` | A `SAMPLE BY` or time-based `GROUP BY` query |
| `TIMESTAMP` | Designate timestamp column for the view |
| `PARTITION BY` | Partitioning unit for view storage |
| `TTL` | Retention period for view data |
| `OWNED BY` | Assign ownership (Enterprise) |

## Rules and defaults[​](#rules-and-defaults "Direct link to Rules and defaults")

| Rule | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Query must aggregate | Requires `SAMPLE BY` or `GROUP BY` with designated timestamp |
| Default refresh | `IMMEDIATE` (refreshes after each base table transaction) |
| WITH BASE required | Must specify when query contains JOINs |
| PARTITION BY sizing | Should be larger than or equal to `SAMPLE BY` interval |

| EVERY minimum | Minimum timer interval is `1m` |

## Valid clause combinations[​](#valid-clause-combinations "Direct link to Valid clause combinations")

| Refresh | DEFERRED | PERIOD | Valid |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| IMMEDIATE | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| MANUAL | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| EVERY interval | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| *(none specified)* | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ (defaults to IMMEDIATE) |

## Basic example[​](#basic-example "Direct link to Basic example")

Base table

```prism-code
CREATE TABLE trades (  
  timestamp TIMESTAMP,  
  symbol SYMBOL,  
  price DOUBLE,  
  amount DOUBLE  
) TIMESTAMP(timestamp) PARTITION BY DAY;
```

Materialized view with hourly aggregation

```prism-code
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW trades_hourly AS  
SELECT  
  timestamp,  
  symbol,  
  avg(price) AS avg_price  
FROM trades  
SAMPLE BY 1h;
```

The view refreshes incrementally each time `trades` receives new data.

## Refresh strategies[​](#refresh-strategies "Direct link to Refresh strategies")

### IMMEDIATE (default)[​](#immediate-default "Direct link to IMMEDIATE (default)")

Refreshes incrementally after each base table transaction:

```prism-code
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW trades_hourly  
REFRESH IMMEDIATE AS  
SELECT timestamp, symbol, avg(price) FROM trades SAMPLE BY 1h;
```

Best for: Real-time dashboards where data freshness matters.

### EVERY interval[​](#every-interval "Direct link to EVERY interval")

Checks for new data and refreshes on a timer schedule:

```prism-code
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW trades_hourly  
REFRESH EVERY 10m AS  
SELECT timestamp, symbol, avg(price) FROM trades SAMPLE BY 1h;
```

Every 10 minutes, QuestDB checks if the base table has new data and performs an
incremental refresh if needed.

With start time and timezone:

```prism-code
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW trades_hourly  
REFRESH EVERY 1h START '2025-01-01T00:00:00Z' TIME ZONE 'Europe/Berlin' AS  
SELECT timestamp, symbol, avg(price) FROM trades SAMPLE BY 1h;
```

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `EVERY interval` | How often to check for updates (e.g., `10m`, `1h`) |
| `START timestamp` | When to begin the schedule |
| `TIME ZONE` | Timezone for schedule alignment |

Best for: Reducing refresh overhead when real-time accuracy isn't required.

note

Minimum interval is `1m`. For faster refresh, use `IMMEDIATE`.

### MANUAL[​](#manual "Direct link to MANUAL")

Refreshes only when explicitly triggered:

```prism-code
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW trades_hourly  
REFRESH MANUAL AS  
SELECT timestamp, symbol, avg(price) FROM trades SAMPLE BY 1h;
```

Trigger refresh with [`REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW`](/docs/query/sql/refresh-mat-view/).

Best for: Full control over refresh timing, batch processing workflows.

### DEFERRED[​](#deferred "Direct link to DEFERRED")

Skips the initial full refresh on creation. Applies to any strategy:

```prism-code
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW trades_hourly  
REFRESH IMMEDIATE DEFERRED AS  
SELECT timestamp, symbol, avg(price) FROM trades SAMPLE BY 1h;
```

The view remains empty until:

* `IMMEDIATE`: Next base table transaction
* `EVERY`: Next scheduled refresh time
* `MANUAL`: Explicit `REFRESH` command

## PERIOD clause[​](#period-clause "Direct link to PERIOD clause")

For data arriving at fixed intervals (e.g., end-of-day prices), use `PERIOD` to
define an in-flight time window that won't refresh until complete.

### Full PERIOD syntax[​](#full-period-syntax "Direct link to Full PERIOD syntax")

```prism-code
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW trades_daily  
REFRESH PERIOD (LENGTH 1d TIME ZONE 'Europe/London' DELAY 2h) AS  
SELECT timestamp, symbol, avg(price) FROM trades SAMPLE BY 1d;
```

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `LENGTH` | Period duration (e.g., `1d`) |
| `TIME ZONE` | Timezone for period boundaries |
| `DELAY` | Grace period before period closes (e.g., `2h` for late data) |

In this example, each day's data refreshes at 2AM London time.

### Compact PERIOD syntax[​](#compact-period-syntax "Direct link to Compact PERIOD syntax")

Matches period to the `SAMPLE BY` interval:

```prism-code
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW trades_hourly  
REFRESH PERIOD (SAMPLE BY INTERVAL) AS  
SELECT timestamp, symbol, avg(price) FROM trades  
SAMPLE BY 1h ALIGN TO CALENDAR TIME ZONE 'Europe/London';
```

Ignores the latest incomplete interval, reducing refresh transactions during
high-velocity ingestion.

### PERIOD with other strategies[​](#period-with-other-strategies "Direct link to PERIOD with other strategies")

Combine `PERIOD` with `EVERY` or `MANUAL`:

Period with timer refresh

```prism-code
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW hourly_stats  
REFRESH EVERY 15m PERIOD (LENGTH 1h DELAY 5m) AS  
SELECT timestamp, symbol, avg(price) FROM trades SAMPLE BY 1h;
```

This configuration:

* Checks for updates every 15 minutes (`EVERY 15m`)
* Processes data in 1-hour chunks (`LENGTH 1h`)
* Waits 5 minutes after each hour ends before refreshing it (`DELAY 5m`)

The `DELAY` allows late-arriving data to be included before the period closes.

Period with manual refresh

```prism-code
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW trades_daily  
REFRESH MANUAL PERIOD (LENGTH 1d TIME ZONE 'UTC' DELAY 1h) AS  
SELECT timestamp, symbol, avg(price) FROM trades SAMPLE BY 1d;
```

With `MANUAL`, refresh only occurs when you run
[`REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW`](/docs/query/sql/refresh-mat-view/) explicitly.

## WITH BASE (for JOINs)[​](#with-base-for-joins "Direct link to WITH BASE (for JOINs)")

When querying multiple tables, specify which table triggers refresh:

```prism-code
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW trades_with_metadata  
WITH BASE trades AS  
SELECT  
  t.timestamp,  
  t.symbol,  
  m.description,  
  avg(t.price) AS avg_price  
FROM trades t  
JOIN instruments m ON t.symbol = m.symbol  
SAMPLE BY 1h;
```

Only changes to `trades` trigger refresh. Changes to `instruments` do not.

## Partitioning[​](#partitioning "Direct link to Partitioning")

Specify storage partitioning with `PARTITION BY`:

```prism-code
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW trades_hourly AS (  
  SELECT timestamp, symbol, avg(price) FROM trades SAMPLE BY 1h  
) PARTITION BY DAY;
```

Options: `YEAR`, `MONTH`, `WEEK`, `DAY`, `HOUR`

If omitted, partitioning is
[inferred from SAMPLE BY](/docs/concepts/materialized-views/#default-partitioning).

warning

Partitioning cannot be changed after creation.

## TTL (Time-To-Live)[​](#ttl-time-to-live "Direct link to TTL (Time-To-Live)")

Limit data retention with `TTL`:

```prism-code
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW trades_hourly AS (  
  SELECT timestamp, symbol, avg(price) FROM trades SAMPLE BY 1h  
) PARTITION BY DAY TTL 7 DAYS;
```

Time units: `HOURS`, `DAYS`, `WEEKS`, `MONTHS`, `YEARS`

The view's TTL is independent of the base table's TTL. See
[TTL documentation](/docs/concepts/ttl/) for details.

## Complete example[​](#complete-example "Direct link to Complete example")

Putting it all together:

Fully specified materialized view

```prism-code
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW IF NOT EXISTS trades_hourly_stats  
WITH BASE trades  
REFRESH EVERY 15m  
  START '2025-01-01T00:00:00Z'  
  TIME ZONE 'UTC'  
  PERIOD (LENGTH 1h DELAY 5m)  
AS (  
  SELECT  
    timestamp,  
    symbol,  
    avg(price) AS avg_price,  
    sum(amount) AS total_volume  
  FROM trades  
  SAMPLE BY 1h  
)  
PARTITION BY DAY TTL 30 DAYS;
```

This creates a view that:

* Checks for updates every 15 minutes (`EVERY 15m`)
* Processes data in 1-hour chunks, waiting 5 minutes for late data (`PERIOD`)
* Aggregates from `trades` table (`WITH BASE trades`)
* Stores hourly averages and volumes (`SAMPLE BY 1h`)
* Keeps 30 days of data (`TTL 30 DAYS`)

## Metadata[​](#metadata "Direct link to Metadata")

Query view metadata with `materialized_views()`:

```prism-code
SELECT view_name, base_table_name, view_status, last_refresh_finish_timestamp  
FROM materialized_views();
```

See [meta functions](/docs/query/functions/meta/) for all available columns.

## Query constraints[​](#query-constraints "Direct link to Query constraints")

Materialized view queries must:

* Use `SAMPLE BY` or `GROUP BY` with designated timestamp
* Not use `FROM-TO`, `FILL`, or `ALIGN TO FIRST OBSERVATION`
* Not use non-deterministic functions (`now()`, `rnd_*`)

See [query constraints](/docs/concepts/materialized-views/#query-constraints)
for the full list.

## Permissions (Enterprise)[​](#permissions-enterprise "Direct link to Permissions (Enterprise)")

Creating and managing materialized views requires specific permissions.

### Required permissions[​](#required-permissions "Direct link to Required permissions")

| Permission | Level | Required for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW` | Database (global) | Creating a materialized view |
| `SELECT` | Table/Column (base table) | All columns referenced in the view query |
| `DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW` | Materialized view | Dropping the view |
| `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW` | Materialized view | Manually refreshing the view |

### Owner permissions[​](#owner-permissions "Direct link to Owner permissions")

When you create a materialized view, you automatically receive all permissions on
it (including `DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW` and `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW`) with the
`GRANT` option.

### OWNED BY clause[​](#owned-by-clause "Direct link to OWNED BY clause")

Assign ownership to a user, group, or service account:

```prism-code
CREATE GROUP analysts;  
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW trades_hourly AS (  
  SELECT timestamp, symbol, avg(price) FROM trades SAMPLE BY 1h  
) OWNED BY analysts;
```

note

External users (authenticated via external identity providers) must specify the
`OWNED BY` clause when creating materialized views.

### Permission examples[​](#permission-examples "Direct link to Permission examples")

Grant permission to create materialized views

```prism-code
GRANT CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW TO user1;
```

Grant SELECT on base table (required to create view from it)

```prism-code
GRANT SELECT ON trades TO user1;
```

Grant permission to refresh a specific view

```prism-code
GRANT REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW ON trades_hourly TO user1;
```

Grant permission to drop a specific view

```prism-code
GRANT DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW ON trades_hourly TO user1;
```

## Errors[​](#errors "Direct link to Errors")

| Error | Cause |
| --- | --- |
| `materialized view already exists` | View exists and `IF NOT EXISTS` not specified |
| `base table does not exist` | Referenced table doesn't exist |
| `query is not supported` | Query doesn't meet constraints (missing SAMPLE BY, uses FILL, etc.) |
| `permission denied` | Missing required permission (Enterprise) |
