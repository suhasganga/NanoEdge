## read\_parquet[​](#read_parquet "Direct link to read_parquet")

Reads a parquet file as a table.

`read_parquet(parquet_file_path)`

### Usage[​](#usage "Direct link to Usage")

With this function, query a Parquet file located at the QuestDB copy root directory. Both relative and absolute file
paths are supported.

read\_parquet example

```prism-code
SELECT  
  *  
FROM  
  read_parquet('trades.parquet')  
WHERE  
  side = 'buy'  
LIMIT 1;
```

| symbol | side | price | amount | timestamp |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BTC-USD | buy | 62755.6 | 0.00043367 | 2024-07-01T00:46:39.754075Z |

The query above:

* Reads all columns from the file `trades.parquet` located at the server copy root directory,
  i.e. `import/trades.parquet` in the QuestDB copy root directory by default.
* Filters rows, keeping only the first row where the `side` column equals `buy`.

### Configuration[​](#configuration "Direct link to Configuration")

For security reason, reading is only allowed from a specified directory. It defaults to the `import` directory
inside the QuestDB copy root directory. To change the allowed directory, set the `cairo.sql.copy.root`
configuration by using one of the following settings:

* The environment variable `QDB_CAIRO_SQL_COPY_ROOT`.
* The `cairo.sql.copy.root` key in `server.conf`.

### Limitations[​](#limitations "Direct link to Limitations")

Parquet format support rich set of data types, including structural types. QuestDB only can read data types that match
QuestDB data types:

* Varchar
* Int
* Long
* Short
* Byte
* Boolean
* UUID
* Double
* Float
* Timestamp
* Binary

Parquet columns with unsupported data types are ignored.

Multiple files are not suppored, only a single file.

Nested data and/or arrays are not supported.
