## l2price[​](#l2price "Direct link to l2price")

Level-2 trade price calculation.

`l2price(target_size, size_array, price_array)`

`l2price(target_size, size_1, price_1, size_2, price_2, ..., size_n, price_n)`

Consider `size_1`, `price_1`, `size_2`, `price_2`, ..., `size_n`,
`price_n` to be either side of an order book with `n` price levels. Then, the
return value of the function is the average trade price of a market order
executed with the size of `target_size` against the book.

Let's take the below order book as an example.

| Size | Bid | Ask | Size |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 10 | 14.10 | 14.50 | 14 |
| 17 | 14.00 | 14.60 | 16 |
| 19 | 13.90 | 14.80 | 23 |
| 21 | 13.70 | 15.10 | 12 |

A *buy market order* with the size of 50 would wipe out the first two price
levels of the *Ask* side of the book, and would also trade on the third level.

The full price of the trade:

14⋅$14.50+16⋅$14.60+(50−14−16)⋅$14.80=$732.6014 \cdot \$14.50 + 16 \cdot \$14.60 + (50 - 14 - 16) \cdot \$14.80 = \$732.6014⋅$14.50+16⋅$14.60+(50−14−16)⋅$14.80=$732.60

The average price of the instrument in this trade:

$732.60/50=$14.652\$732.60 / 50 = \$14.652$732.60/50=$14.652

This average trade price is the output of the function when executed with the
parameters taken from the above example:

```prism-code
select l2price(50, ARRAY[14.0, 16.0, 23.0, 12.0], ARRAY[14.50, 14.60, 14.80, 15.10]);
```

or

```prism-code
select l2price(50, 14, 14.50, 16, 14.60, 23, 14.80, 12, 15.10);
```

| l2price |
| --- |
| 14.652 |

### Parameters[​](#parameters "Direct link to Parameters")

There are two variants of the function, one accepting arrays of numbers,
and the other accepting individual numbers:

The variant with arrays takes a `target size`, and a pair of arrays of type
`DOUBLE[]`: `size` and `price`. The arrays must match in length. Each
element of the array represents a price level of the order book.

The variant with individual numbers takes a `target size`, and a variable
number of `size`/`price` pairs of type `DOUBLE`, or convertible to `DOUBLE`
(`FLOAT`, `LONG`, `INT`, `SHORT`, `BYTE`).

* `target_size`: The size of a hypothetical market order to be filled.
* `size*`: The sizes of offers available at the corresponding price levels (can
  be fractional).
* `price*`: Price levels of the order book.

### Return value[​](#return-value "Direct link to Return value")

The function returns a `double`, representing the average trade price.

It returns `NULL` if the price is not calculable. For example, if the target
size cannot be filled, or there is incomplete data in the set (nulls).

### Examples[​](#examples-1 "Direct link to Examples")

#### Calculate the regression intercept between two variables[​](#calculate-the-regression-intercept-between-two-variables "Direct link to Calculate the regression intercept between two variables")

Using the same measurements table:

| x | y |
| --- | --- |
| 1.0 | 2.0 |
| 2.0 | 3.0 |
| 3.0 | 5.0 |
| 4.0 | 4.0 |
| 5.0 | 6.0 |

Calculate the y-intercept:

SELECT regr_intercept(y, x) AS y_intercept FROM measurements;
```

Result:

| y\_intercept |
| --- |
| 1.4 |

Or: When x is 0, y is predicted to be 1.4 units.

#### Calculate the regression intercept grouped by category[​](#calculate-the-regression-intercept-grouped-by-category "Direct link to Calculate the regression intercept grouped by category")

Using the same sales\_data table:

| category | advertising\_spend | sales |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A | 1000 | 15000 |
| A | 2000 | 22000 |
| A | 3000 | 28000 |
| B | 1500 | 18000 |
| B | 2500 | 26000 |
| B | 3500 | 31000 |

```prism-code
SELECT category, regr_intercept(sales, advertising_spend) AS base_sales  
FROM sales_data  
GROUP BY category;
```

Result:

| category | base\_sales |
| --- | --- |
| A | 9500 |
| B | 12000 |

Or:

* In category A, with no advertising spend, the predicted base sales are 9,500 units
* In category B, with no advertising spend, the predicted base sales are 12,000 units

#### Handling null values[​](#handling-null-values "Direct link to Handling null values")

The function ignores rows where either x or y is null:

```prism-code
SELECT regr_intercept(y, x) AS y_intercept  
FROM (  
    SELECT 1 AS x, 2 AS y  
    UNION ALL SELECT 2, NULL  
    UNION ALL SELECT NULL, 4  
    UNION ALL SELECT 4, 5  
);
```

Result:

| y\_intercept |
| --- |
| 1.4 |

Only the rows where both x and y are not null are considered in the calculation.

## regr\_slope[​](#regr_slope "Direct link to regr_slope")

`regr_slope(y, x)` - Calculates the slope of the linear regression line for the
given numeric columns y (dependent variable) and x (independent variable).

* The function requires at least two valid (x, y) pairs to compute the slope.
  + If fewer than two pairs are available, the function returns null.
* Supported data types for x and y include `double`, `float`, and `integer`
  types.
* The regr\_slope function can be used with other statistical aggregation
  functions like `corr` or `covar_samp`.
* The order of arguments in `regr_slope(y, x)` matters.
  + Ensure that y is the dependent variable and x is the independent variable.

### Calculation[​](#calculation-1 "Direct link to Calculation")

The slope b1b\_1b1​ of the regression line y=b0+b1xy = b\_0 + b\_1 xy=b0​+b1​x is calculated using the
formula:

b1=N∑(xy)−∑x∑yN∑(x2)−(∑x)2b\_1 = \frac{N \sum (xy) - \sum x \sum y}{N \sum (x^2) - (\sum x)^2}b1​=N∑(x2)−(∑x)2N∑(xy)−∑x∑y​

Where:

* NNN is the number of valid data points.
* ∑(xy)\sum (xy)∑(xy) is the sum of the products of xxx and yyy.
* ∑x\sum x∑x and ∑y\sum y∑y is the sums of xxx and yyy values, respectively.
* ∑(x2)\sum (x^2)∑(x2) is the sum of the squares of xxx values.

### Arguments[​](#arguments-1 "Direct link to Arguments")

* y: A numeric column representing the dependent variable.
* x: A numeric column representing the independent variable.

### Return value[​](#return-value-3 "Direct link to Return value")

Return value type is `double`.

changes for a unit change in x.

### Examples[​](#examples-2 "Direct link to Examples")

#### Calculate the regression slope between two variables[​](#calculate-the-regression-slope-between-two-variables "Direct link to Calculate the regression slope between two variables")

Suppose you have a table measurements with the following data:

| x | y |
| --- | --- |
| 1.0 | 2.0 |
| 2.0 | 3.0 |
| 3.0 | 5.0 |
| 4.0 | 4.0 |
| 5.0 | 6.0 |

You can calculate the slope of the regression line between y and x using:

```prism-code
SELECT regr_slope(y, x) AS slope FROM measurements;
```

Result:

| slope |
| --- |
| 0.8 |

Or: The slope of 0.8 indicates that for each unit increase in x, y increases by
0.8 units on average.

#### Calculate the regression slope grouped by a category[​](#calculate-the-regression-slope-grouped-by-a-category "Direct link to Calculate the regression slope grouped by a category")

Consider a table sales\_data:

| category | advertising\_spend | sales |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A | 1000 | 15000 |
| A | 2000 | 22000 |
| A | 3000 | 28000 |
| B | 1500 | 18000 |
| B | 2500 | 26000 |
| B | 3500 | 31000 |

Calculate the regression slope of `sales` versus `advertising_spend` for each
category:

```prism-code
SELECT category, regr_slope(sales, advertising_spend) AS slope FROM sales_data  
GROUP BY category;
```

Result:

| category | slope |
| --- | --- |
| A | 8.5 |
| B | 7.0 |

Or:

* In category A, for every additional unit spent on advertising, sales increase
  by 8.5 units on average.
* In category B, the increase is 7.0 units per advertising unit spent.

#### Handling null values[​](#handling-null-values-1 "Direct link to Handling null values")

If your data contains null values, `regr_slope()` will ignore those rows:

```prism-code
SELECT regr_slope(y, x) AS slope FROM ( SELECT 1 AS x, 2 AS y UNION ALL SELECT  
2, NULL UNION ALL SELECT NULL, 4 UNION ALL SELECT 4, 5 );
```

Result:

| slope |
| --- |
| 0.8 |

Only the rows where both x and y are not null are considered in the calculation.

#### Calculating beta[​](#calculating-beta "Direct link to Calculating beta")

Assuming you have a table `stock_returns` with daily returns for a specific
stock and the market index:

| date | stock\_return | market\_return |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2023-01-01 | 0.5 | 0.4 |
| 2023-01-02 | -0.2 | -0.1 |
| 2023-01-03 | 0.3 | 0.2 |
| ... | ... | ... |

Calculate the stock's beta coefficient:

```prism-code
SELECT regr_slope(stock_return, market_return) AS beta FROM stock_returns;
```

| beta |
| --- |
| 1.2 |

Or: A beta of 1.2 suggests the stock is 20% more volatile than the market.

Remember: The order of arguments in `regr_slope(y, x)` matters.

Ensure that y is the dependent variable and x is the independent variable.

## spread\_bps[​](#spread_bps "Direct link to spread_bps")

`spread_bps(bid, ask)` - calculates the quoted bid-ask spread, based on the
highest bidding price, and the lowest asking price.

The result is provided in basis points, and the calculation is:

{\text{spread}\left(\text{bid}, \text{ask}\right)}
{\text{mid}\left(\text{bid}, \text{ask}\right)}
\cdot
10\,000mid(bid,ask)spread(bid,ask)​⋅10000

## VWAP (Volume-Weighted Average Price)[​](#vwap-volume-weighted-average-price "Direct link to VWAP (Volume-Weighted Average Price)")

For VWAP calculations, use window functions with the typical price formula. This approach is more flexible and works well with high-frequency market data.

See the [VWAP example in Window Functions](/docs/query/functions/window-functions/overview/#vwap-volume-weighted-average-price) for the recommended implementation using `SAMPLE BY` and `CUMULATIVE` window frames.

## wmid[​](#wmid "Direct link to wmid")

`wmid(bidSize, bidPrice, askPrice, askSize)` - calculates the weighted mid-price
for a sized bid/ask pair.

It is calculated with these formulae:

imbalance=bidSize(bidSize+askSize)\text{imbalance} =
\frac
{ \text{bidSize} }
{ \left( \text{bidSize} + \text{askSize} \right) }imbalance=(bidSize+askSize)bidSize​
wmid=askPrice⋅imbalance+bidPrice⋅(1−imbalance)\text{wmid} = \text{askPrice} \cdot \text{imbalance}
+ \text{bidPrice}
\cdot \left( 1 - \text{imbalance} \right)wmid=askPrice⋅imbalance+bidPrice⋅(1−imbalance)

### Parameters[​](#parameters-3 "Direct link to Parameters")

* `bidSize` is any numeric value representing the size of the bid offer.
* `bidPrice` is any numeric value representing the bidding price.
