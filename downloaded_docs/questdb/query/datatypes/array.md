QuestDB supports N-dimensional arrays, modeled after NumPy's `NDArray` type.
Arrays are useful for storing vectors, matrices, and higher-dimensional data
directly in your database.

Arrays currently only support `DOUBLE` elements. Other element types are not yet
available.

## Quick reference[​](#quick-reference "Direct link to Quick reference")

| Operation | Syntax | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Create 1D array | `ARRAY[v1, v2, ...]` | `ARRAY[1.0, 2.0, 3.0]` |
| Create 2D array | `ARRAY[[...], [...]]` | `ARRAY[[1, 2], [3, 4]]` |
| Create 3D array | `ARRAY[[[...]], [[...]]]` | `ARRAY[[[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]]]` |
| Access element | `arr[i, j, ...]` or `arr[i][j]...` | `arr[1, 2, 3]` returns `DOUBLE` |
| Access sub-array | `arr[i]` | `arr[1]` returns lower-dimensional array |
| Slice (range) | `arr[low:high]` | `arr[1:3]` keeps dimensionality |
| Slice (open-ended) | `arr[low:]` | `arr[2:]` to end of dimension |
| Mixed access | `arr[i, low:high]` | `arr[1, 2:4]` |
| Compare arrays | `=`, `<>` | `arr1 = arr2` (same shape and elements) |

Array types are written as `DOUBLE[dim1][dim2]...`, for example:

* `DOUBLE[3]` — 1D array with 3 elements
* `DOUBLE[2][3]` — 2D array (2 rows, 3 columns)
* `DOUBLE[2][3][4]` — 3D array

Indexing is **1-based** (SQL standard). See [array functions](/docs/query/functions/array/) for operations like `array_sum`, `array_avg`, `matmul`, etc.

## Creating arrays[​](#creating-arrays "Direct link to Creating arrays")

You can create an array from scalar values using the `ARRAY[...]` syntax:

```prism-code
CREATE TABLE tango AS (SELECT ARRAY[  
   [ [ 1,  2,  3], [ 4,  5,  6], [ 7,  8,  9] ],  
   [ [10, 11, 12], [13, 14, 15], [16, 17, 18] ],  
   [ [19, 20, 21], [22, 23, 24], [25, 26, 27] ]  
] arr from long_sequence(1));
```

Values can be any expressions that yield scalars, so you can construct the array
from existing column data.

Values can also be arrays, creating a higher-dimensional array:

```prism-code
CREATE TABLE tango AS (SELECT ARRAY[1, 2] arr, ARRAY[3, 4] brr FROM long_sequence(1));  
SELECT ARRAY[arr, brr] FROM tango;
```

| array\_2d |
| --- |
| [[1.0,2.0],[3.0,4.0]] |

## Array access syntax[​](#array-access-syntax "Direct link to Array access syntax")

Array access syntax is modeled on Python's `NDArray`, except
that QuestDB uses 1-based indexing (as is standard in SQL):

```prism-code
arr[<dim1-selector>, <dim2-selector>, ...]
```

Each `dimN-selector` can be one of two forms:

* single integer
* range in the form `low:high`

All the following examples use the 3D array named `arr`, of type
`DOUBLE[3][3][3]`:

```prism-code
CREATE TABLE tango AS (SELECT ARRAY[  
   [ [ 1,  2,  3], [ 4,  5,  6], [ 7,  8,  9] ],  
   [ [10, 11, 12], [13, 14, 15], [16, 17, 18] ],  
   [ [19, 20, 21], [22, 23, 24], [25, 26, 27] ]  
] arr from long_sequence(1));
```

### Single-integer array selector[​](#single-integer-array-selector "Direct link to Single-integer array selector")

Using single integers you select individual array elements. An element of a 2D
array is a 1D sub-array, and an element of a 1D array is an individual scalar
value, like a `DOUBLE`. If you use a coordinate larger than the array's given
dimension length, the result will be `NULL` for scalars, and an empty array for
sub-arrays.

#### Example: select a number from the array[​](#example-select-a-number-from-the-array "Direct link to Example: select a number from the array")

```prism-code
SELECT arr[1, 3, 2] elem FROM tango;
```

| elem |
| --- |
| 8.0 |

This selected the `DOUBLE` number at the coordinates (1, 3, 2). Remember that
the coordinates are 1-based!

tip

The syntax `arr[1, 3, 2]` is interchangeable with `arr[1][3][2]`. The
performance of both styles is the same.

#### Example: select an out-of-range element from the array[​](#example-select-an-out-of-range-element-from-the-array "Direct link to Example: select an out-of-range element from the array")

```prism-code
SELECT arr[1, 3, 4] elem FROM tango;
```

| elem |
| --- |
| NULL |

#### Example: select a 2D sub-array[​](#example-select-a-2d-sub-array "Direct link to Example: select a 2D sub-array")

```prism-code
SELECT arr[1] subarr FROM tango;
```

| subarr |
| --- |
| [[1.0,2.0,3.0],[4.0,5.0,6.0],[7.0,8.0,9.0]] |

This selected the first 2D sub-array in `arr`.

#### Example: select a sub-array that is out-of-range[​](#example-select-a-sub-array-that-is-out-of-range "Direct link to Example: select a sub-array that is out-of-range")

```prism-code
SELECT arr[4] subarr FROM tango;
```

| subarr |
| --- |
| [] |

#### Example: select a 1D sub-array[​](#example-select-a-1d-sub-array "Direct link to Example: select a 1D sub-array")

```prism-code
SELECT arr[1, 3] subarr FROM tango;
```

| subarr |
| --- |
| [7.0,8.0,9.0] |

This selected the first 2D-subarray in `arr`, and then the 3rd 1D-subarray in
it.

### Range selector - slicing[​](#range-selector---slicing "Direct link to Range selector - slicing")

A range of integers selects a slice of the array. You can think of slicing as
leaving the array intact, but constraining the range of numbers you can use for
a coordinate. The lowest valid coordinate remains `1`, but it gets remapped to
the coordinate indicated by the lower bound of the slicing range.

The dimensionality of the result remains the same, even if the range contains
just one number. The slice includes the lower bound, but excludes the upper
bound.

You can omit the upper bound, like this: `arr[2:]`. The slice will then extend
to the end of the array in the corresponding dimension. The lower bound is
mandatory, due to syntax conflict with variable placeholders such as `:a` or
`:2`.

If the upper bound of the range exceeds the array's length, the result is the
same as if the upper bound was left out — the result extends to the end of the
array along that dimension.

#### Example: select a slice of `arr` by constraining the first dimension[​](#example-select-a-slice-of-arr-by-constraining-the-first-dimension "Direct link to example-select-a-slice-of-arr-by-constraining-the-first-dimension")

```prism-code
SELECT arr[2:3] slice FROM tango;
```

| slice |
| --- |
| [[[10.0,11.0,12.0],[13.0,14.0,15.0],[16.0,17.0,18.0]]] |

This returned a `DOUBLE[1][3][3]`, containing just the second sub-array of
`arr`.

#### Example: select a slice of `arr` with a right-open range[​](#example-select-a-slice-of-arr-with-a-right-open-range "Direct link to example-select-a-slice-of-arr-with-a-right-open-range")

```prism-code
SELECT arr[2:] slice FROM tango;
```

| slice |
| --- |
| [[[10.0,11.0,12.0],[13.0,14.0,15.0],[16.0,17.0,18.0]], [[19.0,20.0,21.0],[22.0,23.0,24.0],[25.0,26.0,27.0]]] |

This returned a `DOUBLE[2][3][3]` and contains everything except the first
sub-array along the first dimension.

#### Example: Select a slice of `arr` by constraining the first and second dimensions[​](#example-select-a-slice-of-arr-by-constraining-the-first-and-second-dimensions "Direct link to example-select-a-slice-of-arr-by-constraining-the-first-and-second-dimensions")

```prism-code
SELECT arr[2:3, 3:4] slice FROM tango;
```

| slice |
| --- |
| [[[16.0,17.0,18.0]]] |

Note that the returned array is still 3D.

#### Example: select a slice of `arr` with large upper bounds[​](#example-select-a-slice-of-arr-with-large-upper-bounds "Direct link to example-select-a-slice-of-arr-with-large-upper-bounds")

```prism-code
SELECT arr[2:100, 3:100] slice FROM tango;
```

| slice |
| --- |
| [[[16.0,17.0,18.0]],[[25.0,26.0,27.0]]] |

The result is the same as if using `arr[2:, 3:]`.

### Mixing selectors[​](#mixing-selectors "Direct link to Mixing selectors")

You can use both types of selectors within the same bracket expression.

#### Example: select the first sub-array of `arr`, and slice it[​](#example-select-the-first-sub-array-of-arr-and-slice-it "Direct link to example-select-the-first-sub-array-of-arr-and-slice-it")

```prism-code
SELECT arr[1, 2:4] subarr FROM tango;
```

| subarr |
| --- |
| [[4.0,5.0,6.0],[7.0,8.0,9.0]] |

This returned a `DOUBLE[2][3]`. The top dimension is gone because the first
selector took out a sub-array and not a one-element slice.

#### Example: select discontinuous elements from sub-arrays[​](#example-select-discontinuous-elements-from-sub-arrays "Direct link to Example: select discontinuous elements from sub-arrays")

```prism-code
SELECT arr[1:, 3, 2] subarr FROM tango;
```

| subarr |
| --- |
| [8.0,17.0,26.0] |

This left the top dimension unconstrained, then took the 3rd sub-array in each
of the top-level sub-arrays, and then selected just the 2nd element in each of
them.

## Comparing arrays[​](#comparing-arrays "Direct link to Comparing arrays")

Arrays can be compared using the `=` and `<>` operators. Two arrays are equal if
and only if:

1. They have the same shape (dimensions and lengths)
2. All corresponding elements are equal

```prism-code
SELECT  
  ARRAY[1, 2, 3] = ARRAY[1, 2, 3] as same,  
  ARRAY[1, 2, 3] = ARRAY[1, 2, 4] as different_value,  
  ARRAY[1, 2, 3] = ARRAY[[1, 2, 3]] as different_shape;
```

| same | different\_value | different\_shape |
| --- | --- | --- |
| true | false | false |

`NULL` elements are handled consistently with scalar `DOUBLE` behavior: two
`NULL` values are considered equal when comparing arrays.

```prism-code
SELECT ARRAY[1, NULL, 3] = ARRAY[1, NULL, 3] as with_nulls;
```

| with\_nulls |
| --- |
| true |

## Array functions[​](#array-functions "Direct link to Array functions")

Functions that operate on arrays are documented on a
[dedicated page](/docs/query/functions/array/). There are also some
[financial functions](/docs/query/functions/finance/#l2price) that operate on
arrays.

## Technical details[​](#technical-details "Direct link to Technical details")

This section explains the internal design of N-dimensional arrays. Understanding
these concepts can help you write more efficient queries.

### Memory layout and structure[​](#memory-layout-and-structure "Direct link to Memory layout and structure")

The physical layout of the N-dimensional array is a single memory block with
values arranged (by default) in *row-major* order, where the coordinates of the
adjacent elements differ in the rightmost coordinate first (much like the
adjacent numbers differ in the rightmost digit first: 41, 42, 43, etc.)

Separately, there are two lists of integers that describe this block of values,
and give it its N-dimensional appearance: *shape* and *strides*. Both have
length equal to the number of dimensions.

* the numbers in *shape* tell the length along each dimension -- the range of
  values you can use as a coordinate for that dimension
* the numbers in *strides* tell how far apart are adjacent elements along that
  dimension.

Unlike NumPy, QuestDB expresses strides as element jumps, not byte count jumps.
Strides are used to perform a number of operations (such as transpose, slicing,
etc) without the need to copy the array data itself.

Also unlike NumPy, QuestDB's `DOUBLE[]` allows `NULL` elements, with the same
semantics as plain `DOUBLE` values: all non-finite floating point values (`NaN`,
`Infinity`, `-Infinity`) are seen as `NULL`.

Here's a visual example of a 3-dimensional array of type `DOUBLE[2][3][2]`:

```prism-code
dim 1: |. . . . . .|. . . . . .| -- stride = 6, len = 2  
dim 2: |. .|. .|. .|. .|. .|. .| -- stride = 2, len = 3  
dim 3: |.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.| -- stride = 1, len = 2
```

The dots are the individual values (`DOUBLE` numbers in our case). Each row
shows the whole array, but with different subdivisions according to the
dimension. So, in `dim 1`, the row is divided into two slots, the sub-arrays at
coordinates 1 and 2 along that dimension, and the distance between the start of
slot 1 and slot 2 is 6 (the stride for that dimension). In `dim 3`, each slot
contains an individual number, and the stride is 1.

The legal values for the coordinate in `dim 3` are just 1 and 2, even though you
would be able to access any array element just by using a large-enough number.
This is how the flat array gets its 3-dimensional appearance: for each value,
there's a unique list of coordinates, `[i, j, k]`, that addresses it.

### Efficient operations[​](#efficient-operations "Direct link to Efficient operations")

QuestDB can perform all of the following operations cheaply, by editing just the
two small lists, `shape` and `strides`, and doing nothing to the potentially
huge block of memory holding the array values:

1. *Slice*: extract a 3-dimensional array that is just a part of the full one,
   by constraining the range of legal coordinates at each dimension. Example:
   `array[1:2, 2:4, 1:2]` will give us a view into the array with the shape
   `DOUBLE[1, 2, 1]`, covering just the ranges of coordinates indicated in the
   expression.
2. *Take a sub-array*: constrain the coordinate at a given dimension to just one
   choice, and then eliminate that dimension from the array. Example: `array[2]`
   has the shape `DOUBLE[3, 2]` and consists of the second subarray in the 1st
   dimension.
3. *Flatten*: remove a dimension from the array, flattening it into the
   next-finer dimension. Example: flattening `dim 2` gives us an array shape
   `DOUBLE[2, 6]`. All elements are still available, but using just 2
   coordinates.
4. *Transpose*: reverse the shape and the strides, changing the meaning of each
   coordinate. Example: transposing our array changes the strides from
   `(6, 2, 1)` to `(1, 2, 6)`. What we used to access with the 3rd coordinate,
   we now access with the 1st coordinate. On a 2D array, this would have the
   effect of swapping rows and columns (transposing a matrix).

### Vanilla arrays and performance[​](#vanilla-arrays-and-performance "Direct link to Vanilla arrays and performance")

QuestDB stores the *shape* along with the array. However, it has no need to
store *strides*: they can be calculated from the shape. Strides become relevant
once you perform one of the mentioned array shape transformations. We say that
an array whose shape hasn't been transformed (that is, it matches the physical
arrangement of elements) is a *vanilla* array, and this has consequences for
performance.

A "vanilla" array is just a plain, contiguous N-D array in row-major order. A
vanilla array can be processed by optimized bulk operations that go over the
entire block of memory, disregarding the shape and strides, whereas for most
other arrays we have to step through all the coordinates one by one and
calculate the position of each element.

There's a special case where the array is transformed just so that the new array
can be found in vanilla shape within the memory block of the original array (a
contiguous sub-array). Such a transformed array is also considered vanilla.
Major examples are slicing the array at the top (leftmost) dimension, and taking
a sub-array at the top dimension.

While performing a shape transformation is cheap on its own, whole-array
operations, such as equality checks, adding/multiplying two arrays, etc., are
expected to be faster on vanilla arrays.

QuestDB always stores arrays in vanilla form. If you transform an array's shape
and then store it to the database, QuestDB will physically rearrange the
elements, and store the new array in vanilla shape.
