QuestDB offers high-speed ingestion and low-latency analytics on time-series
data. It stores data in a three-tier architecture (streaming WAL files, local
binary storage, and local or remote storage in Parquet format) to improve
interoperability and avoid vendor lock-in.

**Tier One:** Hot ingest (WAL), durable by default

Incoming data is appended to the write-ahead log (WAL) with ultra-low latency. Writes are made durable before any processing, preserving order and surviving failures without data loss. The WAL is asynchronously shipped to object storage, so new replicas can bootstrap quickly and read the same history.

**Tier Two:** Real-time SQL on live data

Data is time-ordered and de-duplicated into QuestDB's native, time-partitioned columnar format and becomes immediately queryable. Power real-time analysis with vectorized, multi-core execution, streaming materialized views, and time-series SQL (e.g., ASOF JOIN, SAMPLE BY). The query planner spans tiers seamlessly.

**Tier Three:** Cold storage, open and queryable

Older data is automatically tiered to object storage in Apache Parquet. Query it in-place through QuestDB or use any tool that reads Parquet. This delivers predictable costs, interoperability with AI/ML tooling, and zero lock-in.

## Key components[​](#key-components "Direct link to Key components")

QuestDB is comprised of several key components:

* **[Storage engine](/docs/architecture/storage-engine/):** Uses a
  column-oriented design to ensure high I/O performance and low latency.
* **[Memory management and native integration](/docs/architecture/memory-management/):**
  The system leverages both memory mapping and explicit memory management
  techniques, integrating native code for performance-critical tasks.
* **[Query engine](/docs/architecture/query-engine/):** A custom SQL
  parser, a just-in-time (JIT) compiler, and a vectorized execution engine
  process data in table page frames for better CPU use.
* **[Time-series optimizations](/docs/architecture/time-series-optimizations/):**
  QuestDB is specifically designed for time-series, and it provides several
  optimizations, such as a designated timestamp, sequential reads, materialized
  views, and in-memory processing.
* **[Replication](/docs/high-availability/overview/):** QuestDB Enterprise supports
  high availability with read replicas and multi-primary configurations.
  See [High Availability](/docs/high-availability/overview/) for details.
* **[Observability](/docs/architecture/observability/):** QuestDB exposes
  real-time metrics, health checks, and structured logs to monitor performance
  and streamline diagnostics.
* **[Web console](/docs/getting-started/web-console/overview/):** The engine includes
  a web console for running SQL statements, bulk loading CSV files, and
  displaying monitoring dashboards. QuestDB Enterprise supports single sign-on
  (SSO) in the web console.

## Design patterns & best practices throughout the codebase[​](#design-patterns--best-practices-throughout-the-codebase "Direct link to Design patterns & best practices throughout the codebase")

* **Immutable data structures:** The system favors immutability to avoid
  concurrency issues and simplify state management.
* **Modular architecture:** Each component (eg., storage, query processing,
  ingestion, etc.) has well-defined interfaces that enhance maintainability and
  decouple functionality.
* **Factory & builder patterns:** These patterns are used to centralize
  construction logic for complex objects such as SQL execution plans and storage
  buffers.
* **Lazy initialization:** Resource-intensive components initialize only when
  needed to reduce startup overhead.
* **Rigorous testing & benchmarks:**
  [Unit tests, integration tests](https://github.com/questdb/questdb/tree/master/core/src/test),
  and performance benchmarks ensure that new enhancements do not compromise
  reliability or performance.
