## Time-series optimizations[​](#time-series-optimizations "Direct link to Time-series optimizations")

QuestDB is specifically designed for time series, and it provides several optimizations such as a designated timestamp,
sequential reads, materialized views, and in-memory processing.

### Designated timestamp[​](#designated-timestamp "Direct link to Designated timestamp")

* **Timestamp sorting:**
  Data is stored in order of incremental timestamp. Since ingestion is usually
  chronological, the system uses a fast append-only strategy, except for updates and out-of-order data.
* **Rapid interval queries and sequential reads:**
  Sorted data lets the system quickly locate the start and end of data files, which speeds
  up [interval queries](/docs/concepts/deep-dive/interval-scan/). When data is accessed by increasing timestamp,
  reads are sequential for each column file, which makes I/O very efficient.

* **Out-of-order data:**
  When data arrives out of order, QuestDB [rearranges it](/docs/concepts/partitions/#splitting-and-squashing-time-partitions) to maintain timestamp order. The
  engine splits partitions to minimize [write amplification](/docs/getting-started/capacity-planning/#write-amplification) and compacts them in the background.

### Data partitioning and sequential reads[​](#data-partitioning-and-sequential-reads "Direct link to Data partitioning and sequential reads")

* **Partitioning by time:**
  Data [partitions by timestamp](/docs/concepts/partitions/) with hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly resolution.

* **Partition pruning:**
  The design lets the engine skip partitions that fall outside query filters. Combined with
  incremental timestamp sorting, this reduces latency.
* **Lifecycle policies:**
  The system can delete partitions manually or automatically via TTL. It also supports
  detaching or attaching partitions using SQL commands.

### Materialized views[​](#materialized-views "Direct link to Materialized views")

* [Materialized views](https://questdb.com/docs/concepts/materialized-views/) are auto-refreshing tables that store the precomputed results of a query. Unlike regular views, which
  compute their results at query time, materialized views persist their data to disk, making them particularly efficient
  for expensive aggregate queries that are run frequently.
* QuestDB supports materialized views for `SAMPLE BY` queries, including those joining with other tables.
* Materialized sampled intervals are automatically refreshed whenever the base table receives new or updated rows. QuestDB
  supports different strategies for self-refreshing views: Immediate, Timer, or Period (with an optional allowed delay). Views
  can also be configured to refresh only when manually triggered.
* Materialized views can be chained, with the output of one serving as the input to another, and support TTLs for lifecycle management.

### Time-To-Live and Data lifecycle[​](#time-to-live-and-data-lifecycle "Direct link to Time-To-Live and Data lifecycle")

QuestDB supports [Time To Live (TTL)](/docs/concepts/ttl/) configuration for both regular tables and
materialized views. With TTL enabled, partitions older than the configured horizon will automatically
be removed.

An alternative is to use QuestDB Enterprise to automatically move older partitions to [cold storage](/docs/architecture/storage-engine/#tier-three-parquet-locally-or-in-an-object-store), with
old partitions converted to Parquet and stored in object storage, while still being available for
querying by the query engine.

### In-memory processing[​](#in-memory-processing "Direct link to In-memory processing")

* **Caching:**
  The engine uses the OS cache to access recent and frequently accessed data in memory, reducing
  disk reads.
* **Off-heap buffers:**
  Off-heap memory, managed via memory mapping and direct allocation, avoids garbage
  collection overhead.
* **Optimized in-memory handling:**
  Apart from using CPU-level optimizations such as SIMD, QuestDB uses specialized hash tables (all of them with open
  addressing and linear probing) and implements algorithms for reducing the memory
  footprint of many operations.
* **Custom memory layout for different data types:**
  Specialized data types such as `Symbol`, `VARCHAR`, `Array`, or `UUID` are designed to use minimal disk and memory. For example,
  character sequences shorter than 9 bytes are fully inlined within the `VARCHAR` header and do not occupy any additional data space.
