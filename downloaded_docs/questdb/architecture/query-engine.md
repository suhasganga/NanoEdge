## Query engine[​](#query-engine "Direct link to Query engine")

The QuestDB Query Engine includes A custom SQL parser, a just-in-time (JIT) compiler, and a vectorized execution engine
to process data in table page frames for better CPU use.

### SQL parsing & optimization[​](#sql-parsing--optimization "Direct link to SQL parsing & optimization")

* **Custom SQL parser:**
  The parser supports QuestDB's SQL dialect and time-series extensions. It converts SQL queries
  into an optimized abstract syntax tree (AST).
* **Compilation pipeline:**
  The engine compiles SQL into an execution plan through stages that push down predicates and
  rewrite queries to remove unnecessary operations.
* **Optimization techniques:**
  The planner applies rule-based rewrites and simple cost estimations to choose efficient
  execution paths.
* **Columnar reads:**
  Table columns are randomly accessible. Columns with fixed size data types are read by translating
  the record number into a file offset by a simple bit shift. The offset in the column file is then
  translated into an offset in a lazily mapped memory page, where the required value is read from.

### Execution model[​](#execution-model "Direct link to Execution model")

* **Operator pipeline:**
  The execution plan runs as a series of operators (filters, joins, aggregators) in a tightly
  integrated pipeline.

* **JIT compilation and Vectorized processing:**
  Queries with a `WHERE` clause [compile](/docs/concepts/deep-dive/jit-compiler/) critical parts of the execution plan to native machine code (SIMD AVX-2 instructions) just in time. Vectorized instructions apply
  the same operation to many data elements simultaneously. This maximizes CPU cache use and reduces overhead.
* **Multi-threaded execution:**
  On top of the JIT, QuestDB tries to execute as many queries as possible in a multi-threaded,
  multi-core fashion. Some queries, for example those involving an index, are executed on a single
  thread. Other queries, like those involving `GROUP BY` and `SAMPLE BY`, execute a pipeline with some single-threaded stages and some multi-threaded stages to avoid slow downs when groups are unbalanced.
* **Worker pools:** QuestDB allows to configure different pools for specialized functions, like
  parsing incoming data, applying WAL file changes, handling PostgreSQL-Wire protocol, or responding to HTTP connections. By default, most tasks are handled by a shared worker pool.
* **Query plan caching:**
  The system caches query plans for reuse within the same connection. (Query results are not
  cached.)
* **Column data caching:**
  Data pages read from disk are kept in system memory. Sufficient memory prevents frequent disk
  reads.
