* The base endpoint is: **`wss://ws-api.testnet.binance.vision/ws-api/v3`**
  + If you experience issues with the standard 443 port, alternative port 9443 is also available.
* A single connection to the API is only valid for 24 hours; expect to be disconnected after the 24-hour mark.
* We support HMAC, RSA, and Ed25519 keys. For more information, please see [API Key types](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/faqs/api_key_types).
* Responses are in JSON by default. To receive responses in SBE, refer to the [SBE FAQ](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/faqs/sbe_faq) page.
* If your request contains a symbol name containing non-ASCII characters, then the response may contain non-ASCII characters encoded in UTF-8.
* Some methods may return asset and/or symbol names containing non-ASCII characters encoded in UTF-8 even if the request did not contain non-ASCII characters.
* The WebSocket server will send a `ping frame` every 20 seconds.
  + If the WebSocket server does not receive a `pong frame` back from the connection within a minute the connection will be disconnected.
  + When you receive a ping, you must send a pong with a copy of ping's payload as soon as possible.
  + Unsolicited `pong frames` are allowed, but will not prevent disconnection. **It is recommended that the payload for these pong frames are empty.**
* Data is returned in **chronological order**, unless noted otherwise.
  + Without `startTime` or `endTime`, returns the most recent items up to the limit.
  + With `startTime`, returns oldest items from `startTime` up to the limit.
  + With `endTime`, returns most recent items up to `endTime` and the limit.
  + With both, behaves like `startTime` but does not exceed `endTime`.
* All timestamps in the JSON responses are in **milliseconds in UTC by default**. To receive the information in microseconds, please add the parameter `timeUnit=MICROSECOND` or `timeUnit=microsecond` in the URL.
* Timestamp parameters (e.g. `startTime`, `endTime`, `timestamp`) can be passed in milliseconds or microseconds.
* All field names and values are **case-sensitive**, unless noted otherwise.
* If there are enums or terms you want clarification on, please see [SPOT Glossary](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/faqs/spot_glossary) for more information.
* APIs have a timeout of 10 seconds when processing a request. If a response from the Matching Engine takes longer than this, the API responds with "Timeout waiting for response from backend server. Send status unknown; execution status unknown." [(-1007 TIMEOUT)](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/testnet/errors#-1007-timeout)
  + This does not always mean that the request failed in the Matching Engine.
  + If the status of the request has not appeared in [User Data Stream](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/testnet/user-data-stream), please perform an API query for its status.
* **Please avoid SQL keywords in requests** as they may trigger a security block by a WAF (Web Application Firewall) rule. See <https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/detail/360004492232> for more details.
