Requests must be sent as JSON in **text frames**, one request per frame.

Example of request:

```prism-code
{  
    "id": "e2a85d9f-07a5-4f94-8d5f-789dc3deb097",  
    "method": "order.place",  
    "params": {  
        "symbol": "BTCUSDT",  
        "side": "BUY",  
        "type": "LIMIT",  
        "price": "0.1",  
        "quantity": "10",  
        "timeInForce": "GTC",  
        "timestamp": 1655716096498,  
        "apiKey": "T59MTDLWlpRW16JVeZ2Nju5A5C98WkMm8CSzWC4oqynUlTm1zXOxyauT8LmwXEv9",  
        "signature": "5942ad337e6779f2f4c62cd1c26dba71c91514400a24990a3e7f5edec9323f90"  
    }  
}
```

Request fields:

| Name | Type | Mandatory | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | INT / STRING / `null` | YES | Arbitrary ID used to match responses to requests |
| `method` | STRING | YES | Request method name |
| `params` | OBJECT | NO | Request parameters. May be omitted if there are no parameters |

* Request `id` is truly arbitrary. You can use UUIDs, sequential IDs, current timestamp, etc.
  The server does not interpret `id` in any way, simply echoing it back in the response.

  You can freely reuse IDs within a session.
  However, be careful to not send more than one request at a time with the same ID,
  since otherwise it might be impossible to tell the responses apart.
* Request method names may be prefixed with explicit version: e.g., `"v3/order.place"`.
* The order of `params` is not significant.
