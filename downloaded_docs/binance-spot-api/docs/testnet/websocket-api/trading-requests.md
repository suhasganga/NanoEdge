Send in a new order.

This adds 1 order to the `EXCHANGE_MAX_ORDERS` filter and the `MAX_NUM_ORDERS` filter.

**Weight:**
1

**Unfilled Order Count:**
1

**Parameters:**

| Name | Type | Mandatory | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

| `icebergQty` | DECIMAL | NO |  |
| `strategyId` | LONG | NO | Arbitrary numeric value identifying the order within an order strategy. |
| `strategyType` | INT | NO | Arbitrary numeric value identifying the order strategy.  Values smaller than `1000000` are reserved and cannot be used. |
| `selfTradePreventionMode` | ENUM | NO | The allowed enums is dependent on what is configured on the symbol. Supported values: [STP Modes](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/testnet/enums#stpmodes) |
| `pegPriceType` | ENUM | NO | `PRIMARY_PEG` or `MARKET_PEG`   See [Pegged Orders](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/testnet/websocket-api/trading-requests#pegged-orders) |
| `pegOffsetValue` | INT | NO | Price level to peg the price to (max: 100)   See [Pegged Orders](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/testnet/websocket-api/trading-requests#pegged-orders) |
| `pegOffsetType` | ENUM | NO | Only `PRICE_LEVEL` is supported   See [Pegged Orders](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/testnet/websocket-api/trading-requests#pegged-orders) |
| `apiKey` | STRING | YES |  |
| `recvWindow` | DECIMAL | NO | The value cannot be greater than `60000`.   Supports up to three decimal places of precision (e.g., 6000.346) so that microseconds may be specified. |
| `signature` | STRING | YES |  |
| `timestamp` | LONG | YES |  |

Certain parameters (\*) become mandatory based on the order `type`:

| Order `type` | Mandatory parameters |
| --- | --- |
| `LIMIT` | * `timeInForce` * `price` * `quantity` |
| `LIMIT_MAKER` | * `price` * `quantity` |
| `MARKET` | * `quantity` or `quoteOrderQty` |
| `STOP_LOSS` | * `quantity` * `stopPrice` or `trailingDelta` |
| `STOP_LOSS_LIMIT` | * `timeInForce` * `price` * `quantity` * `stopPrice` or `trailingDelta` |
| `TAKE_PROFIT` | * `quantity` * `stopPrice` or `trailingDelta` |
| `TAKE_PROFIT_LIMIT` | * `timeInForce` * `price` * `quantity` * `stopPrice` or `trailingDelta` |

Supported order types:

| Order `type` | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `LIMIT` | Buy or sell `quantity` at the specified `price` or better. |
| `LIMIT_MAKER` | `LIMIT` order that will be rejected if it immediately matches and trades as a taker.  This order type is also known as a POST-ONLY order. |
| `MARKET` | Buy or sell at the best available market price.   * `MARKET` order with `quantity` parameter   specifies the amount of the *base asset* you want to buy or sell.   Actually executed quantity of the quote asset will be determined by available market liquidity.  E.g., a MARKET BUY order on BTCUSDT for `"quantity": "0.1000"`   specifies that you want to buy 0.1 BTC at the best available price.   If there is not enough BTC at the best price, keep buying at the next best price,   until either your order is filled, or you run out of USDT, or market runs out of BTC. * `MARKET` order with `quoteOrderQty` parameter   specifies the amount of the *quote asset* you want to spend (when buying) or receive (when selling).   Actually executed quantity of the base asset will be determined by available market liquidity.  E.g., a MARKET BUY on BTCUSDT for `"quoteOrderQty": "100.00"`   specifies that you want to buy as much BTC as you can for 100 USDT at the best available price.   Similarly, a SELL order will sell as much available BTC as needed for you to receive 100 USDT   (before commission). |
| `STOP_LOSS` | Execute a `MARKET` order for given `quantity` when specified conditions are met.  I.e., when `stopPrice` is reached, or when `trailingDelta` is activated. |
| `STOP_LOSS_LIMIT` | Place a `LIMIT` order with given parameters when specified conditions are met. |
| `TAKE_PROFIT` | Like `STOP_LOSS` but activates when market price moves in the favorable direction. |
| `TAKE_PROFIT_LIMIT` | Like `STOP_LOSS_LIMIT` but activates when market price moves in the favorable direction. |

Notes on using parameters for Pegged Orders:

* These parameters are allowed for `LIMIT`, `LIMIT_MAKER`, `STOP_LOSS_LIMIT`, `TAKE_PROFIT_LIMIT` orders.
* If `pegPriceType` is specified, `price` becomes optional. Otherwise, it is still mandatory.
* `pegPriceType=PRIMARY_PEG` means the primary peg, that is the best price on the same side of the order book as your order.
* `pegPriceType=MARKET_PEG` means the market peg, that is the best price on the opposite side of the order book from your order.
* Use `pegOffsetType` and `pegOffsetValue` to request a price level other than the best one. These parameters must be specified together.

Available `timeInForce` options,
setting how long the order should be active before expiration:

| TIF | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `GTC` | **Good 'til Canceled** – the order will remain on the book until you cancel it, or the order is completely filled. |
| `IOC` | **Immediate or Cancel** – the order will be filled for as much as possible, the unfilled quantity immediately expires. |
| `FOK` | **Fill or Kill** – the order will expire unless it cannot be immediately filled for the entire quantity. |

Notes:

* `newClientOrderId` specifies `clientOrderId` value for the order.

  A new order with the same `clientOrderId` is accepted only when the previous one is filled or expired.
* Any `LIMIT` or `LIMIT_MAKER` order can be made into an iceberg order by specifying the `icebergQty`.

  An order with an `icebergQty` must have `timeInForce` set to `GTC`.
* Trigger order price rules for `STOP_LOSS`/`TAKE_PROFIT` orders:

  + `stopPrice` must be above market price: `STOP_LOSS BUY`, `TAKE_PROFIT SELL`
  + `stopPrice` must be below market price: `STOP_LOSS SELL`, `TAKE_PROFIT BUY`
* `MARKET` orders using `quoteOrderQty` follow [`LOT_SIZE`](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/testnet/filters#lot_size) filter rules.

  The order will execute a quantity that has notional value as close as possible to requested `quoteOrderQty`.

**Conditional fields in Order Responses**

There are fields in the order responses (e.g. order placement, order query, order cancellation) that appear only if certain conditions are met.

These fields can apply to Order lists.

The fields are listed below:

| Field | Description | Visibility conditions | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `icebergQty` | Quantity for the iceberg order | Appears only if the parameter `icebergQty` was sent in the request. | `"icebergQty": "0.00000000"` |

| `stopPrice` | Price when the algorithmic order will be triggered | Appears for `STOP_LOSS`. `TAKE_PROFIT`, `STOP_LOSS_LIMIT` and `TAKE_PROFIT_LIMIT` orders. | `"stopPrice": "23500.00000000"` |
| `strategyId` | Can be used to label an order that's part of an order strategy. | Appears if the parameter was populated in the request. | `"strategyId": 37463720` |
| `strategyType` | Can be used to label an order that is using an order strategy. | Appears if the parameter was populated in the request. | `"strategyType": 1000000` |
| `trailingDelta` | Delta price change required before order activation | Appears for Trailing Stop Orders. | `"trailingDelta": 10` |
| `trailingTime` | Time when the trailing order is now active and tracking price changes | Appears only for Trailing Stop Orders. | `"trailingTime": -1` |
| `usedSor` | Field that determines whether order used SOR | Appears when placing orders using SOR | `"usedSor": true` |
| `workingFloor` | Field that determines whether the order is being filled by the SOR or by the order book the order was submitted to. | Appears when placing orders using SOR | `"workingFloor": "SOR"` |
| `pegPriceType` | Price peg type | Only for pegged orders | `"pegPriceType": "PRIMARY_PEG"` |
| `pegOffsetType` | Price peg offset type | Only for pegged orders, if requested | `"pegOffsetType": "PRICE_LEVEL"` |
| `pegOffsetValue` | Price peg offset value | Only for pegged orders, if requested | `"pegOffsetValue": 5` |

Cancel an active order.

**Weight:**
1

**Parameters:**

| Name | Type | Mandatory | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `symbol` | STRING | YES |  |
| `orderId` | LONG | YES | Cancel order by `orderId` |
| `origClientOrderId` | STRING | Cancel order by `clientOrderId` |
| `newClientOrderId` | STRING | NO | New ID for the canceled order. Automatically generated if not sent |
| `cancelRestrictions` | ENUM | NO | Supported values:  `ONLY_NEW` - Cancel will succeed if the order status is `NEW`.  `ONLY_PARTIALLY_FILLED` - Cancel will succeed if order status is `PARTIALLY_FILLED`. |
| `apiKey` | STRING | YES |  |
| `recvWindow` | DECIMAL | NO | The value cannot be greater than 60000.  Supports up to three decimal places of precision (e.g., 6000.346) so that microseconds may be specified. |
| `signature` | STRING | YES |  |
| `timestamp` | LONG | YES |  |

Notes:

* If both `orderId` and `origClientOrderId` parameters are provided, the `orderId` is searched first, then the `origClientOrderId` from that result is checked against that order. If both conditions are not met the request will be rejected.
* `newClientOrderId` will replace `clientOrderId` of the canceled order, freeing it up for new orders.
* If you cancel an order that is a part of an order list, the entire order list is canceled.
* The performance for canceling an order (single cancel or as part of a cancel-replace) is always better when only `orderId` is sent. Sending `origClientOrderId` or both `orderId` + `origClientOrderId` will be slower.

Cancel an existing order and immediately place a new order instead of the canceled one.

A new order that was not attempted (i.e. when `newOrderResult: NOT_ATTEMPTED`), will still increase the unfilled order count by 1.

Similar to the [`order.place`](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/testnet/websocket-api/trading-requests#place-new-order-trade) request,
additional mandatory parameters (\*) are determined by the new order [`type`](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/testnet/websocket-api/trading-requests#order-type).

Available `cancelReplaceMode` options:

* `STOP_ON_FAILURE` – if cancellation request fails, new order placement will not be attempted.
* `ALLOW_FAILURE` – new order placement will be attempted even if the cancel request fails.

Notes:

* If both `cancelOrderId` and `cancelOrigClientOrderId` parameters are provided, the `cancelOrderId` is searched first, then the `cancelOrigClientOrderId` from that result is checked against that order. If both conditions are not met the request will be rejected.
* `cancelNewClientOrderId` will replace `clientOrderId` of the canceled order, freeing it up for new orders.
* `newClientOrderId` specifies `clientOrderId` value for the placed order.

  A new order with the same `clientOrderId` is accepted only when the previous one is filled or expired.

  The new order can reuse old `clientOrderId` of the canceled order.
* This cancel-replace operation is **not transactional**.

  If one operation succeeds but the other one fails, the successful operation is still executed.

  For example, in `STOP_ON_FAILURE` mode, if the new order placement fails, the old order is still canceled.
* Filters and order count limits are evaluated before cancellation and order placement occurs.
* If new order placement is not attempted, your order count is still incremented.
* Like [`order.cancel`](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/testnet/websocket-api/trading-requests#cancel-order-trade), if you cancel an individual order from an order list, the entire order list is canceled.
* The performance for canceling an order (single cancel or as part of a cancel-replace) is always better when only `orderId` is sent. Sending `origClientOrderId` or both `orderId` + `origClientOrderId` will be slower.

In `STOP_ON_FAILURE` mode, failed order cancellation prevents new order from being placed
and returns the following response with `"status": 400`:

If cancel-replace mode allows failure and one of the operations fails,
you get a response with `"status": 409`,
and the `"data"` field detailing which operation succeeded, which failed, and why:

Send in an one-cancels-the-other (OCO) pair, where activation of one order immediately cancels the other.

* An OCO has 2 orders called the **above order** and **below order**.
* One of the orders must be a `LIMIT_MAKER/TAKE_PROFIT/TAKE_PROFIT_LIMIT` order and the other must be `STOP_LOSS` or `STOP_LOSS_LIMIT` order.
* Price restrictions:
  + If the OCO is on the `SELL` side:
    - `LIMIT_MAKER/TAKE_PROFIT_LIMIT` `price` > Last Traded Price > `STOP_LOSS/STOP_LOSS_LIMIT` `stopPrice`
    - `TAKE_PROFIT stopPrice` > Last Traded Price > `STOP_LOSS/STOP_LOSS_LIMIT stopPrice`
  + If the OCO is on the `BUY` side:
    - `LIMIT_MAKER` `price` < Last Traded Price < `STOP_LOSS/STOP_LOSS_LIMIT` `stopPrice`
    - `TAKE_PROFIT stopPrice >` Last Traded Price `> STOP_LOSS/STOP_LOSS_LIMIT stopPrice`
* OCOs add **2 orders** to the `EXCHANGE_MAX_ORDERS` filter and `MAX_NUM_ORDERS` filter.

Places an OTO.

* An OTO (One-Triggers-the-Other) is an order list comprised of 2 orders.
* The first order is called the **working order** and must be `LIMIT` or `LIMIT_MAKER`. Initially, only the working order goes on the order book.
* The second order is called the **pending order**. It can be any order type except for `MARKET` orders using parameter `quoteOrderQty`. The pending order is only placed on the order book when the working order gets **fully filled**.
* If either the working order or the pending order is cancelled individually, the other order in the order list will also be canceled or expired.
* When the order list is placed, if the working order gets **immediately fully filled**, the placement response will show the working order as `FILLED` but the pending order will still appear as `PENDING_NEW`. You need to query the status of the pending order again to see its updated status.
* OTOs add **2 orders** to the `EXCHANGE_MAX_NUM_ORDERS` filter and `MAX_NUM_ORDERS` filter.

Place an OTOCO.

* An OTOCO (One-Triggers-One-Cancels-the-Other) is an order list comprised of 3 orders.
* The first order is called the **working order** and must be `LIMIT` or `LIMIT_MAKER`. Initially, only the working order goes on the order book.
  + The behavior of the working order is the same as the [OTO](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/testnet/websocket-api/trading-requests#place-new-order-list---oto-trade).
* OTOCO has 2 pending orders (pending above and pending below), forming an OCO pair. The pending orders are only placed on the order book when the working order gets **fully filled**.
  + The rules of the pending above and pending below follow the same rules as the [Order list OCO](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/testnet/websocket-api/trading-requests#new-order-list---oco-trade).
* OTOCOs add **3 orders** to the `EXCHANGE_MAX_NUM_ORDERS` filter and `MAX_NUM_ORDERS` filter.

Cancel an active order list.

**Weight**:
1

**Parameters:**

| Name | Type | Mandatory | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `symbol` | STRING | YES |  |
| `orderListId` | INT | YES | Cancel order list by `orderListId` |
| `listClientOrderId` | STRING | Cancel order list by `listClientId` |
| `newClientOrderId` | STRING | NO | New ID for the canceled order list. Automatically generated if not sent |
| `apiKey` | STRING | YES |  |
| `recvWindow` | DECIMAL | NO | The value cannot be greater than 60000.  Supports up to three decimal places of precision (e.g., 6000.346) so that microseconds may be specified. |
| `signature` | STRING | YES |  |
| `timestamp` | LONG | YES |  |

Notes:

* If both `orderListId` and `listClientOrderId` parameters are provided, the `orderListId` is searched first, then the `listClientOrderId` from that result is checked against that order. If both conditions are not met the request will be rejected.
* Canceling an individual order with [`order.cancel`](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/testnet/websocket-api/trading-requests#cancel-order-trade) will cancel the entire order list as well.
