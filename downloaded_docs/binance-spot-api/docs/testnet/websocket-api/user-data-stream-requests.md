### User Data Stream subscription[​](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/testnet/websocket-api/user-data-stream-requests#user-data-stream-subscription "Direct link to User Data Stream subscription")

**General information:**

* [User Data Stream](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/testnet/user-data-stream) subscriptions allow you to receive all the events related to a given account on a WebSocket connection.
* There are 2 ways to start a subscription:
  + If you have an authenticated session, then you can subscribe to events for that authenticated account using [`userDataStream.subscribe`](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/testnet/websocket-api/user-data-stream-requests#user-data-stream-subscribe).
  + In any session, authenticated or not, you can subscribe to events for one or more accounts for which you can provide an API Key signature, using [`userdataStream.subscribe.signature`](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/testnet/websocket-api/user-data-stream-requests#user-data-signature).
  + You can have only one active subscription for a given account on a given connection.
* Subscriptions are identified by a `subscriptionId` which is returned when starting the subscription. That `subscriptionId` allows you to map the events you receive to a given subscription.
  + All active subscriptions for a session can be found using [`session.subscriptions`](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/testnet/websocket-api/user-data-stream-requests#session-subscription).
* Limits
  + A single session supports **up to 1,000 active subscriptions** simultaneously.
    - Attempting to start a new subscription beyond this limit will result in an error.
    - If your accounts are very active, we suggest not opening too many subscriptions at once, in order to not overload your connection.
  + A single session can handle a maximum of **65,535 total subscriptions** over its lifetime.
    - If this limit is reached, you will receive an error and must re-establish a new connection to be able to start new subscriptions.
* To verify the status of User Data Stream subscriptions, check the `userDataStream` field in [`session.status`](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/testnet/websocket-api/authentication-requests#session-status):
  + `null` - User Data Stream subscriptions are **not available** on this WebSocket API.
  + `true` - There is at **least one subscription active** in this session.
  + `false` - There are **no active subscriptions** in this session.

#### Subscribe to User Data Stream (USER\_STREAM)[​](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/testnet/websocket-api/user-data-stream-requests#subscribe-to-user-data-stream-user_stream "Direct link to Subscribe to User Data Stream (USER_STREAM)")

```prism-code
{  
    "id": "d3df8a21-98ea-4fe0-8f4e-0fcea5d418b7",  
    "method": "userDataStream.subscribe"  
}
```

Subscribe to the User Data Stream in the current WebSocket connection.

**Notes:**

* This method requires an authenticated WebSocket connection using Ed25519 keys. Please refer to [`session.logon`](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/testnet/websocket-api/authentication-requests#session-logon).
* To check the subscription status, use [`session.status`](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/testnet/websocket-api/authentication-requests#session-status), see the `userDataStream` flag indicating you have have an active subscription.
* User Data Stream events are available in both JSON and [SBE](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/faqs/sbe_faq) sessions.
  + Please refer to [User Data Streams](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/testnet/user-data-stream) for the event format details.
  + For SBE, only SBE schema 2:1 or later is supported.
