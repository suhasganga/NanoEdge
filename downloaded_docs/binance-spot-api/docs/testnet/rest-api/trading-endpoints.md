**Unfilled Order Count:**
1

**Parameters:**

| Name | Type | Mandatory | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| symbol | STRING | YES |  |
| side | ENUM | YES | Please see [Enums](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/testnet/enums#side) for supported values. |
| type | ENUM | YES | Please see [Enums](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/testnet/enums#ordertypes) for supported values. |

| quantity | DECIMAL | NO |  |
| quoteOrderQty | DECIMAL | NO |  |
| price | DECIMAL | NO |  |
| newClientOrderId | STRING | NO | A unique id among open orders. Automatically generated if not sent.  Orders with the same `newClientOrderID` can be accepted only when the previous one is filled, otherwise the order will be rejected. |
| strategyId | LONG | NO |  |
| strategyType | INT | NO | The value cannot be less than `1000000`. |
| stopPrice | DECIMAL | NO | Used with `STOP_LOSS`, `STOP_LOSS_LIMIT`, `TAKE_PROFIT`, and `TAKE_PROFIT_LIMIT` orders. |
| trailingDelta | LONG | NO | See [Trailing Stop order FAQ](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/faqs/trailing-stop-faq). |
| icebergQty | DECIMAL | NO | Used with `LIMIT`, `STOP_LOSS_LIMIT`, and `TAKE_PROFIT_LIMIT` to create an iceberg order. |
| newOrderRespType | ENUM | NO | Set the response JSON. `ACK`, `RESULT`, or `FULL`; `MARKET` and `LIMIT` order types default to `FULL`, all other orders default to `ACK`. |
| selfTradePreventionMode | ENUM | NO | The allowed enums is dependent on what is configured on the symbol. The possible supported values are: [STP Modes](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/testnet/enums#stpmodes). |
| pegPriceType | ENUM | NO | `PRIMARY_PEG` or `MARKET_PEG`.   See [Pegged Orders Info](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/testnet/rest-api/trading-endpoints#pegged-orders-info) |
| pegOffsetValue | INT | NO | Price level to peg the price to (max: 100).  See [Pegged Orders Info](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/testnet/rest-api/trading-endpoints#pegged-orders-info) |
| pegOffsetType | ENUM | NO | Only `PRICE_LEVEL` is supported.   See [Pegged Orders Info](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/testnet/rest-api/trading-endpoints#pegged-orders-info) |
| recvWindow | DECIMAL | NO | The value cannot be greater than `60000`.   Supports up to three decimal places of precision (e.g., 6000.346) so that microseconds may be specified. |
| timestamp | LONG | YES |  |

Some additional mandatory parameters based on order `type`:

| Type | Additional mandatory parameters | Additional Information |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `LIMIT` | `timeInForce`, `quantity`, `price` |  |
| `MARKET` | `quantity` or `quoteOrderQty` | `MARKET` orders using the `quantity` field specifies the amount of the `base asset` the user wants to buy or sell at the market price.   E.g. MARKET order on BTCUSDT will specify how much BTC the user is buying or selling.    `MARKET` orders using `quoteOrderQty` specifies the amount the user wants to spend (when buying) or receive (when selling) the `quote` asset; the correct `quantity` will be determined based on the market liquidity and `quoteOrderQty`.   E.g. Using the symbol BTCUSDT:   `BUY` side, the order will buy as many BTC as `quoteOrderQty` USDT can.   `SELL` side, the order will sell as much BTC needed to receive `quoteOrderQty` USDT. |
| `STOP_LOSS` | `quantity`, `stopPrice` or `trailingDelta` | This will execute a `MARKET` order when the conditions are met. (e.g. `stopPrice` is met or `trailingDelta` is activated) |
| `STOP_LOSS_LIMIT` | `timeInForce`, `quantity`, `price`, `stopPrice` or `trailingDelta` |  |
| `TAKE_PROFIT` | `quantity`, `stopPrice` or `trailingDelta` | This will execute a `MARKET` order when the conditions are met. (e.g. `stopPrice` is met or `trailingDelta` is activated) |
| `TAKE_PROFIT_LIMIT` | `timeInForce`, `quantity`, `price`, `stopPrice` or `trailingDelta` |  |
| `LIMIT_MAKER` | `quantity`, `price` | This is a `LIMIT` order that will be rejected if the order immediately matches and trades as a taker.   This is also known as a POST-ONLY order. |

Notes on using parameters for Pegged Orders:

* These parameters are allowed for `LIMIT`, `LIMIT_MAKER`, `STOP_LOSS_LIMIT`, `TAKE_PROFIT_LIMIT` orders.
* If `pegPriceType` is specified, `price` becomes optional. Otherwise, it is still mandatory.
* `pegPriceType=PRIMARY_PEG` means the primary peg, that is the best price on the same side of the order book as your order.
* `pegPriceType=MARKET_PEG` means the market peg, that is the best price on the opposite side of the order book from your order.
* Use `pegOffsetType` and `pegOffsetValue` to request a price level other than the best one. These parameters must be specified together.

Other info:

* Any `LIMIT` or `LIMIT_MAKER` type order can be made an iceberg order by sending an `icebergQty`.
* Any order with an `icebergQty` MUST have `timeInForce` set to `GTC`.
* For `STOP_LOSS`, `STOP_LOSS_LIMIT`, `TAKE_PROFIT_LIMIT` and `TAKE_PROFIT` orders, `trailingDelta` can be combined with `stopPrice`.
* `MARKET` orders using `quoteOrderQty` will not break `LOT_SIZE` filter rules; the order will execute a `quantity` that will have the notional value as close as possible to `quoteOrderQty`.
  Trigger order price rules against market price for both MARKET and LIMIT versions:
* Price above market price: `STOP_LOSS` `BUY`, `TAKE_PROFIT` `SELL`
* Price below market price: `STOP_LOSS` `SELL`, `TAKE_PROFIT` `BUY`

```prism-code
GET /api/v3/order
```

Check an order's status.

**Weight:**
4

**Parameters:**

| Name | Type | Mandatory | Description |

### Cancel order (TRADE)[​](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/testnet/rest-api/trading-endpoints#cancel-order-trade "Direct link to Cancel order (TRADE)")

```prism-code
DELETE /api/v3/order
```

Cancel an active order.

**Weight:**
1

**Parameters:**

| Name | Type | Mandatory | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| symbol | STRING | YES |  |
| orderId | LONG | NO |  |
| origClientOrderId | STRING | NO |  |
| newClientOrderId | STRING | NO | Used to uniquely identify this cancel. Automatically generated by default. |
| cancelRestrictions | ENUM | NO | Supported values:  `ONLY_NEW` - Cancel will succeed if the order status is `NEW`.  `ONLY_PARTIALLY_FILLED`  - Cancel will succeed if order status is `PARTIALLY_FILLED`. |
| recvWindow | DECIMAL | NO | The value cannot be greater than `60000`.   Supports up to three decimal places of precision (e.g., 6000.346) so that microseconds may be specified. |
| timestamp | LONG | YES |  |

Notes:

* Either `orderId` or `origClientOrderId` must be sent.
* If both `orderId` and `origClientOrderId` are provided, the `orderId` is searched first, then the `origClientOrderId` from that result is checked against that order. If both conditions are not met the request will be rejected.

**Response:**

```prism-code
{  
    "symbol": "LTCBTC",  
    "origClientOrderId": "myOrder1",  
    "orderId": 4,  
    "orderListId": -1, // Unless it's part of an order list, value will be -1  
    "clientOrderId": "cancelMyOrder1",  
    "transactTime": 1684804350068,

    "cummulativeQuoteQty": "0.00000000",  
    "status": "CANCELED",  
    "timeInForce": "GTC",  
    "type": "LIMIT",  
    "side": "BUY",  
    "selfTradePreventionMode": "NONE"  
}
```

**Notes:**

* The payload above does not show all fields that can appear in the order response. Please refer to [Conditional fields in Order Responses](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/testnet/rest-api/trading-endpoints#conditional-fields-in-order-responses).
* The performance for canceling an order (single cancel or as part of a cancel-replace) is always better when only `orderId` is sent. Sending `origClientOrderId` or both `orderId` + `origClientOrderId` will be slower.

**Regarding `cancelRestrictions`**

* If the `cancelRestrictions` value is not any of the supported values, the error will be:

```prism-code
{  
    "code": -1145,  
    "msg": "Invalid cancelRestrictions"  
}
```

* If the order did not pass the conditions for `cancelRestrictions`, the error will be:

```prism-code
{  
    "code": -2011,  
    "msg": "Order was not canceled due to cancel restrictions."  
}
```

### Cancel an Existing Order and Send a New Order (TRADE)[​](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/testnet/rest-api/trading-endpoints#cancel-an-existing-order-and-send-a-new-order-trade "Direct link to Cancel an Existing Order and Send a New Order (TRADE)")

```prism-code
POST /api/v3/order/cancelReplace
```

Cancels an existing order and places a new order on the same symbol.

Filters and Order Count are evaluated before the processing of the cancellation and order placement occurs.

A new order that was not attempted (i.e. when `newOrderResult: NOT_ATTEMPTED`), will still increase the unfilled order count by 1.

**Weight:**
1

**Unfilled Order Count:**
1

**Parameters:**

| Name | Type | Mandatory | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| symbol | STRING | YES |  |
| side | ENUM | YES |  |
| type | ENUM | YES |  |
| cancelReplaceMode | ENUM | YES | The allowed values are:   `STOP_ON_FAILURE` - If the cancel request fails, the new order placement will not be attempted.   `ALLOW_FAILURE` - new order placement will be attempted even if cancel request fails. |
| timeInForce | ENUM | NO |  |
| quantity | DECIMAL | NO |  |
| quoteOrderQty | DECIMAL | NO |  |
| price | DECIMAL | NO |  |
| cancelNewClientOrderId | STRING | NO | Used to uniquely identify this cancel. Automatically generated by default. |
| cancelOrigClientOrderId | STRING | NO | Either `cancelOrderId` or `cancelOrigClientOrderId` must be sent.    If both `cancelOrderId` and `cancelOrigClientOrderId` parameters are provided, the `cancelOrderId` is searched first, then the `cancelOrigClientOrderId` from that result is checked against that order.    If both conditions are not met the request will be rejected. |
| cancelOrderId | LONG | NO | Either `cancelOrderId` or `cancelOrigClientOrderId` must be sent.   If both `cancelOrderId` and `cancelOrigClientOrderId` parameters are provided, the `cancelOrderId` is searched first, then the `cancelOrigClientOrderId` from that result is checked against that order.   If both conditions are not met the request will be rejected. |
| newClientOrderId | STRING | NO | Used to identify the new order. |
| strategyId | LONG | NO |  |
| strategyType | INT | NO | The value cannot be less than `1000000`. |
| stopPrice | DECIMAL | NO |  |
| trailingDelta | LONG | NO | See [Trailing Stop order FAQ](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/faqs/trailing-stop-faq) |
| icebergQty | DECIMAL | NO |  |
| newOrderRespType | ENUM | NO | Allowed values:   `ACK`, `RESULT`, `FULL`   `MARKET` and `LIMIT` orders types default to `FULL`; all other orders default to `ACK` |
| selfTradePreventionMode | ENUM | NO | The allowed enums is dependent on what is configured on the symbol. The possible supported values are: [STP Modes](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/testnet/enums#stpmodes). |
| cancelRestrictions | ENUM | NO | Supported values:  `ONLY_NEW` - Cancel will succeed if the order status is `NEW`.  `ONLY_PARTIALLY_FILLED`  - Cancel will succeed if order status is `PARTIALLY_FILLED`. For more information please refer to [Regarding `cancelRestrictions`](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/testnet/rest-api/trading-endpoints#regarding-cancelrestrictions) |
| orderRateLimitExceededMode | ENUM | No | Supported values:   `DO_NOTHING` (default)- will only attempt to cancel the order if account has not exceeded the unfilled order rate limit  `CANCEL_ONLY` - will always cancel the order |
| pegPriceType | ENUM | NO | `PRIMARY_PEG` or `MARKET_PEG`   See [Pegged Orders](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/testnet/rest-api/trading-endpoints#pegged-orders-info) |
| pegOffsetValue | INT | NO | Price level to peg the price to (max: 100)   See [Pegged Orders](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/testnet/rest-api/trading-endpoints#pegged-orders-info) |
| pegOffsetType | ENUM | NO | Only `PRICE_LEVEL` is supported   See [Pegged Orders](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/testnet/rest-api/trading-endpoints#pegged-orders-info) |
| recvWindow | DECIMAL | NO | The value cannot be greater than `60000`.   Supports up to three decimal places of precision (e.g., 6000.346) so that microseconds may be specified. |
| timestamp | LONG | YES |  |

Similar to `POST /api/v3/order`, additional mandatory parameters are determined by `type`.

Response format varies depending on whether the processing of the message succeeded, partially succeeded, or failed.

**Notes:**

* The payload above does not show all fields that can appear. Please refer to [Conditional fields in Order Responses](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/testnet/rest-api/trading-endpoints#conditional-fields-in-order-responses).
* The performance for canceling an order (single cancel or as part of a cancel-replace) is always better when only `orderId` is sent. Sending `origClientOrderId` or both `orderId` + `origClientOrderId` will be slower.

```prism-code
POST /api/v3/orderList/oco
```

Send in an one-cancels-the-other (OCO) pair, where activation of one order immediately cancels the other.

* An OCO has 2 orders called the **above order** and **below order**.
* One of the orders must be a `LIMIT_MAKER/TAKE_PROFIT/TAKE_PROFIT_LIMIT` order and the other must be `STOP_LOSS` or `STOP_LOSS_LIMIT` order.
* Price restrictions
  + If the OCO is on the `SELL` side:
    - `LIMIT_MAKER/TAKE_PROFIT_LIMIT` `price` > Last Traded Price > `STOP_LOSS/STOP_LOSS_LIMIT` `stopPrice`
    - `TAKE_PROFIT stopPrice` > Last Traded Price > `STOP_LOSS/STOP_LOSS_LIMIT stopPrice`
  + If the OCO is on the `BUY` side:
    - `LIMIT_MAKER/TAKE_PROFIT_LIMIT price` < Last Traded Price < `stopPrice`
    - `TAKE_PROFIT stopPrice` < Last Traded Price < `STOP_LOSS/STOP_LOSS_LIMIT stopPrice`
* OCOs add **2 orders** to the `EXCHANGE_MAX_ORDERS` filter and the `MAX_NUM_ORDERS` filter.

#### New Order list - OTO (TRADE)[​](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/testnet/rest-api/trading-endpoints#new-order-list---oto-trade "Direct link to New Order list - OTO (TRADE)")

```prism-code
POST /api/v3/orderList/oto
```

Place an OTO.

* An OTO (One-Triggers-the-Other) is an order list comprised of 2 orders.
* The first order is called the **working order** and must be `LIMIT` or `LIMIT_MAKER`. Initially, only the working order goes on the order book.
* The second order is called the **pending order**. It can be any order type except for `MARKET` orders using parameter `quoteOrderQty`. The pending order is only placed on the order book when the working order gets **fully filled**.
* If either the working order or the pending order is cancelled individually, the other order in the order list will also be canceled or expired.
* When the order list is placed, if the working order gets **immediately fully filled**, the placement response will show the working order as `FILLED` but the pending order will still appear as `PENDING_NEW`. You need to query the status of the pending order again to see its updated status.
* OTOs add **2 orders** to the `EXCHANGE_MAX_NUM_ORDERS` filter and `MAX_NUM_ORDERS` filter.

#### Cancel Order list (TRADE)[​](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/testnet/rest-api/trading-endpoints#cancel-order-list-trade "Direct link to Cancel Order list (TRADE)")

```prism-code
DELETE /api/v3/orderList
```

Cancel an entire Order list

**Weight:**
1

**Parameters:**

| Name | Type | Mandatory | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| symbol | STRING | YES |  |
| orderListId | LONG | NO | Either `orderListId` or `listClientOrderId` must be provided |
| listClientOrderId | STRING | NO | Either `orderListId` or `listClientOrderId` must be provided |
| newClientOrderId | STRING | NO | Used to uniquely identify this cancel. Automatically generated by default |
| recvWindow | DECIMAL | NO | The value cannot be greater than `60000`.   Supports up to three decimal places of precision (e.g., 6000.346) so that microseconds may be specified. |
| timestamp | LONG | YES |  |

**Notes:**

* Canceling an individual order from an order list will cancel the entire order list.
* If both `orderListId` and `listClientOrderId` parameters are provided, the `orderListId` is searched first, then the `listClientOrderId` from that result is checked against that order. If both conditions are not met the request will be rejected.
