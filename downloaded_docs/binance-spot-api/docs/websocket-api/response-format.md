Response fields:

| Name | Type | Mandatory | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | INT / STRING / `null` | YES | Same as in the original request |
| `status` | INT | YES | Response status. See [Status codes](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/websocket-api/response-format#status-codes) |
| `result` | OBJECT / ARRAY | YES | Response content. Present if request succeeded |
| `error` | OBJECT | Error description. Present if request failed |
| `rateLimits` | ARRAY | NO | Rate limiting status. See [Rate limits](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/websocket-api/response-format#rate-limits) |

### Status codes[​](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/websocket-api/response-format#status-codes "Direct link to Status codes")

Status codes in the `status` field are the same as in HTTP.

Here are some common status codes that you might encounter:

* `200` indicates a successful response.
* `4XX` status codes indicate invalid requests; the issue is on your side.
  + `400` – your request failed, see `error` for the reason.
  + `403` – you have been blocked by the Web Application Firewall. This can indicate a rate limit violation or a security block. See <https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/detail/360004492232> for more details.
  + `409` – your request partially failed but also partially succeeded, see `error` for details.
  + `418` – you have been auto-banned for repeated violation of rate limits.
  + `429` – you have exceeded API request rate limit, please slow down.
* `5XX` status codes indicate internal errors; the issue is on Binance's side.
  + **Important:** If a response contains 5xx status code, it **does not** necessarily mean that your request has failed.
    Execution status is *unknown* and the request might have actually succeeded.
    Please use query methods to confirm the status.
    You might also want to establish a new WebSocket connection for that.

See [Error codes for Binance](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/errors) for a list of error codes and messages.
