**Note:** Only *Ed25519* keys are supported for this feature.

If you do not want to specify `apiKey` and `signature` in each individual request,
you can authenticate your API key for the active WebSocket session.

Once authenticated, you no longer have to specify `apiKey` and `signature` for those requests that need them.
Requests will be performed on behalf of the account owning the authenticated API key.

**Note:** You still have to specify the `timestamp` parameter for `SIGNED` requests.

### Authenticate after connection[​](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/websocket-api/session-authentication#authenticate-after-connection "Direct link to Authenticate after connection")

You can authenticate an already established connection using session authentication requests:

* [`session.logon`](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/websocket-api/session-authentication#log-in-with-api-key-signed) – authenticate, or change the API key associated with the connection
* [`session.status`](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/websocket-api/session-authentication#query-session-status) – check connection status and the current API key
* [`session.logout`](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/websocket-api/session-authentication#log-out-of-the-session) – forget the API key associated with the connection

**Regarding API key revocation:**

If during an active session the API key becomes invalid for *any reason* (e.g. IP address is not whitelisted, API key was deleted, API key doesn't have correct permissions, etc), after the next request the session will be revoked with the following error message:

```prism-code
{  
    "id": null,  
    "status": 401,  
    "error": {  
        "code": -2015,  
        "msg": "Invalid API-key, IP, or permissions for action."  
    }  
}
```

### Authorize *ad hoc* requests[​](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/websocket-api/session-authentication#authorize-ad-hoc-requests "Direct link to authorize-ad-hoc-requests")

Only one API key can be authenticated with the WebSocket connection.
The authenticated API key is used by default for requests that require an `apiKey` parameter.
However, you can always specify the `apiKey` and `signature` explicitly for individual requests,
overriding the authenticated API key and using a different one to authorize a specific request.

For example, you might want to authenticate your `USER_DATA` key to be used by default,
but specify the `TRADE` key with an explicit signature when placing orders.
