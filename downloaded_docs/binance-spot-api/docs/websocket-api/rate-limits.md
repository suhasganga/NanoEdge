### Connection limits[​](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/websocket-api/rate-limits#connection-limits "Direct link to Connection limits")

There is a limit of **300 connections per attempt every 5 minutes**.

The connection is per **IP address**.

### General information on rate limits[​](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/websocket-api/rate-limits#general-information-on-rate-limits "Direct link to General information on rate limits")

* Current API rate limits can be queried using the [`exchangeInfo`](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/websocket-api/rate-limits#exchange-information) request.
* There are multiple rate limit types across multiple intervals.
* Responses can indicate current rate limit status in the optional `rateLimits` field.
* Requests fail with status `429` when unfilled order count or request rate limits are violated.

#### How to interpret rate limits[​](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/websocket-api/rate-limits#how-to-interpret-rate-limits "Direct link to How to interpret rate limits")

A response with rate limit status may look like this:

```prism-code
{  
    "id": "7069b743-f477-4ae3-81db-db9b8df085d2",  
    "status": 200,  
    "result": {  
        "serverTime": 1656400526260  
    },  
    "rateLimits": [  
        {  
            "rateLimitType": "REQUEST_WEIGHT",  
            "interval": "MINUTE",  
            "intervalNum": 1,  
            "limit": 6000,  
            "count": 70  
        }  
    ]  
}
```

The `rateLimits` array describes all currently active rate limits affected by the request.

| Name | Type | Mandatory | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `rateLimitType` | ENUM | YES | Rate limit type: `REQUEST_WEIGHT`, `ORDERS` |
| `interval` | ENUM | YES | Rate limit interval: `SECOND`, `MINUTE`, `HOUR`, `DAY` |
| `intervalNum` | INT | YES | Rate limit interval multiplier |
| `limit` | INT | YES | Request limit per interval |
| `count` | INT | YES | Current usage per interval |

Rate limits are accounted by intervals.

For example, a `1 MINUTE` interval starts every minute.
Request submitted at 00:01:23.456 counts towards the 00:01:00 minute's limit.
Once the 00:02:00 minute starts, the count will reset to zero again.

Other intervals behave in a similar manner.
For example, `1 DAY` rate limit resets at 00:00 UTC every day,
and `10 SECOND` interval resets at 00, 10, 20... seconds of each minute.

APIs have multiple rate-limiting intervals.
If you exhaust a shorter interval but the longer interval still allows requests,
you will have to wait for the shorter interval to expire and reset.
If you exhaust a longer interval, you will have to wait for that interval to reset,
even if shorter rate limit count is zero.

#### How to show/hide rate limit information[​](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/websocket-api/rate-limits#how-to-showhide-rate-limit-information "Direct link to How to show/hide rate limit information")

`rateLimits` field is included with every response by default.

However, rate limit information can be quite bulky.
If you are not interested in detailed rate limit status of every request,
the `rateLimits` field can be omitted from responses to reduce their size.

* Optional `returnRateLimits` boolean parameter in request.

  Use `returnRateLimits` parameter to control whether to include `rateLimits` fields in response to individual requests.

  Default request and response:

  ```prism-code
  { "id": 1, "method": "time" }
  ```

  ```prism-code
  {  
      "id": 1,  
      "status": 200,  
      "result": { "serverTime": 1656400526260 },  
      "rateLimits": [  
          {  
              "rateLimitType": "REQUEST_WEIGHT",  
              "interval": "MINUTE",  
              "intervalNum": 1,  
              "limit": 6000,  
              "count": 70  
          }  
      ]  
  }
  ```

  Request and response without rate limit status:

  ```prism-code
  { "id": 2, "method": "time", "params": { "returnRateLimits": false } }
  ```

  ```prism-code
  { "id": 2, "status": 200, "result": { "serverTime": 1656400527891 } }
  ```
* Optional `returnRateLimits` boolean parameter in connection URL.

  If you wish to omit `rateLimits` from all responses by default,
  use `returnRateLimits` parameter in the query string instead:

  ```prism-code
  wss://ws-api.binance.com:443/ws-api/v3?returnRateLimits=false
  ```

  This will make all requests made through this connection behave as if you have passed `"returnRateLimits": false`.

  If you *want* to see rate limits for a particular request,
  you need to explicitly pass the `"returnRateLimits": true` parameter.

**Note:** Your requests are still rate limited if you hide the `rateLimits` field in responses.

### IP limits[​](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/websocket-api/rate-limits#ip-limits "Direct link to IP limits")

* Every request has a certain **weight**, added to your limit as you perform requests.
  + The heavier the request (e.g. querying data from multiple symbols), the more weight the request will cost.
  + Connecting to WebSocket API costs 2 weight.
* Current weight usage is indicated by the `REQUEST_WEIGHT` rate limit type.
* Use the [`exchangeInfo`](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/websocket-api/rate-limits#exchange-information) request
  to keep track of the current weight limits.
* Weight is accumulated **per IP address** and is shared by all connections from that address.
* If you go over the weight limit, requests fail with status `429`.
  + This status code indicates you should back off and stop spamming the API.
  + Rate-limited responses include a `retryAfter` field, indicating when you can retry the request.
* **Repeatedly violating rate limits and/or failing to back off after receiving 429s will result in an automated IP ban and you will be disconnected.**
  + Requests from a banned IP address fail with status `418`.
  + `retryAfter` field indicates the timestamp when the ban will be lifted.
* IP bans are tracked and **scale in duration** for repeat offenders, **from 2 minutes to 3 days**.

Successful response indicating that in 1 minute you have used 70 weight out of your 6000 limit:

```prism-code
{  
    "id": "7069b743-f477-4ae3-81db-db9b8df085d2",  
    "status": 200,  
    "result": [],  
    "rateLimits": [  
        {  
            "rateLimitType": "REQUEST_WEIGHT",  
            "interval": "MINUTE",  
            "intervalNum": 1,  
            "limit": 6000,  
            "count": 70  
        }  
    ]  
}
```

Failed response indicating that you are banned and the ban will last until epoch `1659146400000`:

```prism-code

    "id": "fc93a61a-a192-4cf4-bb2a-a8f0f0c51e06",

        }  
    },

        {  
            "rateLimitType": "REQUEST_WEIGHT",  
            "interval": "MINUTE",  
            "intervalNum": 1,  
            "limit": 6000,  
            "count": 2411  
        }  
    ]  
}
```

### Unfilled Order Count[​](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/websocket-api/rate-limits#unfilled-order-count "Direct link to Unfilled Order Count")

* Successfully placed orders update the `ORDERS` rate limit type.
* Rejected or unsuccessful orders might or might not update the `ORDERS` rate limit type.
* **Please note that if your orders are consistently filled by trades, you can continuously place orders on the API**. For more information, please see [Spot Unfilled Order Count Rules](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/faqs/order_count_decrement).
* Use the [`account.rateLimits.orders`](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/websocket-api/account-requests#query-unfilled-order-count) request to keep track of how many orders you have placed within this interval.
* If you exceed this, requests fail with status `429`.
  + This status code indicates you should back off and stop spamming the API.
  + Responses that have a status `429` include a `retryAfter` field, indicating when you can retry the request.
* This is maintained **per account** and is shared by all API keys of the account.

Successful response indicating that you have placed 12 orders in 10 seconds, and 4043 orders in the past 24 hours:
